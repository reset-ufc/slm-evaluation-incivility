The day before yesterday I placed the drive in another external enclosure and it worked well during backups (only transferring several hundreds of MiB of data per backup job incrementally via rsync) until I decided to run a scrub and check everything: after several hours the drive again screamed and made hearable noises of a head-crash and/or sector re-allocation (had those in the past) and access wasn't possible anymore to the drive\nthat's where the above posted message occured again\nso at least in the second case (ST3000DM001) ZFS seemingly showed indirectly that something was wrong with the hardware/harddrive\nso when encountering this message - make sure to double- or triple-check that it's not a hardware-issue instead a \"software\"- (ZFS-related) problem",

The Debian 8 OS is independent and located on two internal SATA-SSD disks of both 16 GB in RAID1 using Linux MD for mirroring. The CPU is an Intel E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40GHz with 6 cores/12 threads. Out of these 6 cores 4 vCPUs have been pinned to the host/hypervisor/dom0 using the `dom0_max_vcpus=4 dom0_vcpus_pin` Linux kernel options. The server has 64 GB of TruDDR4 ECC memory and out of this 64 GB of memory 6 GB has been reserved to the host/hypervisor/dom0 using the respective Linux kernel options `dom0_mem=6G,max:6G`. Finally I have reserved 2 GB RAM of these 6 GB for the ARC using the following `zfs_arc_max=2147483648` zfs module option. I have also disabled ZFS prefetch if that is of any relevance (`zfs_prefetch_disable=1`).\nBelow is the output of an actual ARC summary (server has bee rebooted 5 days ago):\n```\nZFS Subsystem Report\tTue Feb 07 15:11:32 2017\nARC Summary: (HEALTHY)\nMemory Throttle Count:\t0\nARC Misc:\nDeleted:\t3.05m\nMutex Misses:\t7\nEvict Skips:\t7\nARC Size:\t77.69%\t1.55\tGiB\nTarget Size: (Adaptive)\t100.00%\t2.00\tGiB\nMin Size (Hard Limit):\t1.56%\t32.00\tMiB\nMax Size (High Water):\t64:1\t2.00\tGiB\nARC Size Breakdown:\nRecently Used Cache Size:\t93.75%\t1.88\tGiB\nFrequently Used Cache Size:\t6.25%\t128.00\tMiB\nARC Hash Breakdown:\nElements Max:\t171.83k\nElements Current:\t97.97%\t168.34k\nCollisions:\t68.60m\nChain Max:\t6\nChains:\t12.12k\nARC Total accesses:\t102.96m\nCache Hit Ratio:\t48.88%\t50.32m\nCache Miss Ratio:\t51.12%\t52.63m\nActual Hit Ratio:\t48.88%\t50.32m\nData Demand Efficiency:\t0.00%\t49.34m\nCACHE HITS BY CACHE LIST:\nMost Recently Used:\t63.44%\t31.92m\nMost Frequently Used:\t36.56%\t18.40m\nMost Recently Used Ghost:\t0.08%\t42.37k\nMost Frequently Used Ghost:\t0.00%\t0\nCACHE HITS BY DATA TYPE:\nDemand Data:\t0.00%\t167\nPrefetch Data:\t0.00%\t0\nDemand Metadata:\t100.00%\t50.32m\nPrefetch Metadata:\t0.00%\t0\nCACHE MISSES BY DATA TYPE:\nDemand Data:\t93.74%\t49.34m\nPrefetch Data:\t0.00%\t0\nDemand Metadata:\t6.26%\t3.29m\nPrefetch Metadata:\t0.00%\t145\nZFS Tunable:\nmetaslab_debug_load 0\nzfs_arc_min_prefetch_lifespan 0\nzfetch_max_streams 8\nzfs_nopwrite_enabled 1\nzfetch_min_sec_reap 2\nzfs_dbgmsg_enable 0\nzfs_dirty_data_max_max_percent 25\nzfs_arc_p_aggressive_disable 1\nspa_load_verify_data 1\nzfs_zevent_cols 80\nzfs_dirty_data_max_percent 10\nzfs_sync_pass_dont_compress 5\nl2arc_write_max 8388608\nzfs_vdev_scrub_max_active 2\nzfs_vdev_sync_write_min_active 10\nzvol_prefetch_bytes 131072\nmetaslab_aliquot 524288\nzfs_no_scrub_prefetch 0\nzfs_arc_shrink_shift 0\nzfetch_block_cap 256\nzfs_txg_history 0\nzfs_delay_scale 500000\nzfs_vdev_async_write_active_min_dirty_percent 30\nmetaslab_debug_unload 0\nzfs_read_history 0\nzvol_max_discard_blocks 16384\nzfs_recover 0\nl2arc_headroom 2\nzfs_deadman_synctime_ms 1000000\nzfs_scan_idle 50\nzfs_free_min_time_ms 1000\nzfs_dirty_data_max 624856268\nzfs_vdev_async_read_min_active 1\nzfs_mg_noalloc_threshold 0\nzfs_dedup_prefetch 0\nzfs_vdev_max_active 1000\nl2arc_write_boost 8388608\nzfs_resilver_min_time_ms 3000\nzfs_vdev_async_write_max_active 10\nzil_slog_limit 1048576\nzfs_prefetch_disable 1\nzfs_resilver_delay 2\nmetaslab_lba_weighting_enabled 1\nzfs_mg_fragmentation_threshold 85\nl2arc_feed_again 1\nzfs_zevent_console 0\nzfs_immediate_write_sz 32768\nzfs_dbgmsg_maxsize 4194304\nzfs_free_leak_on_eio 0\nzfs_deadman_enabled 1\nmetaslab_bias_enabled 1\nzfs_arc_p_dampener_disable 1\nzfs_object_mutex_size 64\nzfs_metaslab_fragmentation_threshold 70\nzfs_no_scrub_io 0\nmetaslabs_per_vdev 200\nzfs_dbuf_state_index 0\nzfs_vdev_sync_read_min_active 10\nmetaslab_fragmentation_factor_enabled 1\nzvol_inhibit_dev 0\nzfs_vdev_async_write_active_max_dirty_percent 60\nzfs_vdev_cache_size 0\nzfs_vdev_mirror_switch_us 10000\nzfs_dirty_data_sync 67108864\nspa_config_path /etc/zfs/zpool.cache\nzfs_dirty_data_max_max 1562140672\nzfs_arc_lotsfree_percent 10\nzfs_zevent_len_max 64\nzfs_scan_min_time_ms 1000\nzfs_arc_sys_free 0\nzfs_arc_meta_strategy 1\nzfs_vdev_cache_bshift 16\nzfs_arc_meta_adjust_restarts 4096\nzfs_max_recordsize 1048576\nzfs_vdev_scrub_min_active 1\nzfs_vdev_read_gap_limit 32768\nzfs_arc_meta_limit 0\nzfs_vdev_sync_write_max_active 10\nl2arc_norw 0\nzfs_arc_meta_prune 10000\nmetaslab_preload_enabled 1\nl2arc_nocompress 0\nzvol_major 230\nzfs_vdev_aggregation_limit 131072\nzfs_flags 0\nspa_asize_inflation 24\nzfs_admin_snapshot 0\nl2arc_feed_secs 1\nzio_taskq_batch_pct 75\nzfs_sync_pass_deferred_free 2\nzfs_disable_dup_eviction 0\nzfs_arc_grow_retry 0\nzfs_read_history_hits 0\nzfs_vdev_async_write_min_active 1\nzfs_vdev_async_read_max_active 3\nzfs_scrub_delay 4\nzfs_delay_min_dirty_percent 60\nzfs_free_max_blocks 100000\nzfs_vdev_cache_max 16384\nzio_delay_max 30000\nzfs_top_maxinflight 32\nignore_hole_birth 1\nspa_slop_shift 5\nzfs_vdev_write_gap_limit 4096\nspa_load_verify_metadata 1\nspa_load_verify_maxinflight 10000\nl2arc_noprefetch 1\nzfs_vdev_scheduler noop\nzfs_expire_snapshot 300\nzfs_sync_pass_rewrite 2\nzil_replay_disable 0\nzfs_nocacheflush 0\nzfs_arc_max 2147483648\nzfs_arc_min 0\nzfs_read_chunk_size 1048576\nzfs_txg_timeout 5\nzfs_pd_bytes_max 52428800\nl2arc_headroom_boost 200\nzfs_send_corrupt_data 0\nl2arc_feed_min_ms 200\nzfs_arc_meta_min 0\nzfs_arc_average_blocksize 8192\nzfetch_array_rd_sz 1048576\nzfs_autoimport_disable 1\nzfs_arc_p_min_shift 0\nzio_requeue_io_start_cut_in_line 1\nzfs_vdev_sync_read_max_active 10\nzfs_mdcomp_disable 0\nzfs_arc_num_sublists_per_state 4\n```\nDo you need any more information? and what do you think about this setup? is my hardware undersized?",

In addition, pretending that the tutorial of\nscikit-learn is perfect in spite all the questions regarding loading the\nreal data (not the toy data as it is too easy to be imported comparing to\nthe real data) is something needs to be reconsidered, and this means that\nscikit-learn staff don't care about the name of scikit-learn at all.\nSecond, we can understand from your unsuitable way of talking that you\nalready forgot that scikit-learn is a product, and we as users are\ncustomers, so either you or the staff of scikit-learn should respect all of\nus and thank us for any comment or bug fixing. This is the professional way\nof behavior. So I recommend you to think of your words before saying them. If\nyou are knowing the way of loading the real data and you'd like to help,\ndon't only say go see pandas, better you answer people's question nicely\nrather than hurting them with your words, but if you're simply not able to\ndo that, so keep quite.\nOn the other hand, regarding the question \"should we instead add as a\nsection in the tutorial here?\", I would like to say \"_YES_\", you or\nscikit-learn staff should add a section in the official tutorial about how\nto load your own data either CSV, or ARFF or text or whatever, as users are\ninterested to load their own data, this is very critical issue should be\nconsidered in the tutorial (not to be ignored). *If you rely on the user,\nthen what is your work? *\nNevertheless, for those who are still struggling with scikit-learn, I would\nlike to say, this is not the end of the world, and as I mentioned\npreviously, find another to tool make your life much easier. For this\nreason, and in order to save your time, I would like to recommend some\ntools to assist you in data mining procedures. For instance, Waikato\nEnvironment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA),\nhttp://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/, last version is WEKA 3-7-13, is a\ncollection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. WEKA\nallows you to use its schemes either from GUI or writing Java code, so its\nvery easy for non-programmers. Additional to WEKA, R is also an excellent\ntool for data mining stuff, you can also perform tasks of R from WEKA or\nvice versa. However, if you have a patience to design a prediction process\nmanually (drag/drop), RapidMiner is a great tool for this propose where you\ncan design a very nice flow to achieve your target.\nThanks David van Leeuwen for your support.\nGood luck in your analysis.\nCheers,\nMartin\n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/3808#issuecomment-160153930\n> .",

Gael has in fact contributed a lot of user guides himself to scikit learn to help users.\nThe reason why he was opposing that addition to the tutorial was that there are multitude of ways in which users have their data stored and such a user guide on how to get the input data from all of them (a text file/csv file/database/zipped archive), is indeed out of scope for scikit learn, which is a machine learning library.\nThe most important thing to note here is that **it is very clearly explained by documentations of libraries which handle data, like numpy or pandas.**\nIt is expected from the user that he or she knows this! Since it seems to not be very clear, he suggests that we add a FAQ, pointing the user to such userguides, which are more elaborate than we could possibly get :)\nIt may appear that our tutorial could be a bit more elaborate on how the inputs are obtained. But the thing, in general, with userguides is that, it could _always_ be a little bit more elaborate, which makes us set a hard limit on how detailed our userguides can get, to help contain the userguide in a maintainable format :) If you think from that perspective, you yourself would understand our situation.\nAs this issue is open someone will indeed send a PR soon adding a nice FAQ entry and an example, maybe, which could help clarify your (or any other new user's) doubts on input formats.\nCheers!",

        "message": "Hello @MartinLion ,\nwe understand your eagerness to solve your problem, and your frustration when it is not solved.\nHowever, you seem quite misinformed about what is scikit-learn, how it works, and how the project is developed. Therefore, I would like to make some points clear for you. As you can see from\nhttp://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html, scikit-learn is a community effort that is developed by a team of volunteers, mostly on their free time. Ga\u00ebl is one of the creators of the project and its current leader:\nscikit-learn would certainly not be the same without his contribution (the same for other volunteers), and he certainly did not deserve your dismissive words.\nWhat I would like to emphasize is that there is no such thing as a scikit-learn \"product\", or scikit-learn \"staff\" (only a handful of people have worked full time on the project). You mention \"we as users are\ncustomers\", but how much are you paying for using scikit-learn? Despite the important development cost, users get scikit-learn for free (and of course that's how it's intended to be). In fact, the development of the project relies on a fragile alchemy: users' needs being a top priority for developers, and users reporting bugs and concerns in the most positive way. The kind of \"ranting\" that you wrote can be very discouraging for developers, who contribute their free time and their expertise just because they believe that scikit-learn is a useful tool for the community. Some prominent developers stopped contributing to open-source software precisely because of such \"customer-like attitude\" of a few people underlining only shortcomings, and dismissing the huge development efforts. Please try to see the bright side as well: you received advice and comments from a lot of people, I'm sure that there was something for you to learn out of it, even if it did not solve your problem. Also, although users' needs are indeed a top priority of scikit-learn (it has an amazing documentation, of which most scientific Python packages can be jealous!), each software addresses a well-targeted niche of users, and it is just normal that scikit-learn cannot fit all users. For example, it is preferable to use scikit-learn with already a good knowledge of Scientific Python. So, I'm really glad that you found a\npackage that suited your needs better, but please also acknowledge the time and good will that people gave away when answering you.\nSo, folks, let's all show some good will and keep a constructive dialog.\nThat's how the project we love will keep on rocking!",

        "message": "Perhaps I should elaborate on my original frustration, to give you some context. I've been programming in Python almost exclusively for a year now (I am a late convert), and am fairly familiar with the ecosystem---I've done lot's of webservice related things, but also manipulation of resources related to automatic speech recognition. I do my scientific work in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) since a couple of years, and before that, in R, octave, c++/c (some 30 years in total). The Julia ecosystem is quite dynamic, and it is all very exciting, but Python just has this very large ecosystem and very clean coding, which makes it very attractive to use for little side experiments. This time I had to do some topic classification of (single sentence) text documents. Now there is an abundant choice of language technology tools in Python, and I believe that via [lda](https://pythonhosted.org/lda/index.html) I got to scikit-learn. Great tutorials, lovely datasets and all, but I found it very difficult to find out how to organize my own data so that I could load this in. Just now, I browsed through the user guide again to find the docs for \"load_files\", but I could't find an entry. So a google search for \"sklearn.datasets.load_files\" got me there just now, and I happened to remember the particular module path from more painstaking searches yesterday (it is mentioned somewhere in a tutorial). For me, the essential information would have been: \"Organize your data one document per file, one directory per class\"---more or less what's under the documentation for [load_files](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_files.html). This all makes perfect sense, but I come from a community where usual formats are \"one datapoint per line\", often with the class label on that line. But having said all this, I am pretty impressed how the Python (text) community has standardized data representation, from what I've seen so far. But perhaps because of the widely used standard data representation, this aspect has naturally less attention in documentation. As a final note, whenever I try to teach students how to use some scientific tool set or another, I have to spend quite some time on \"how to import your data\". Nobody likes to do it, it can be a lot of effort for what you potentially use only once, and is therefore always a difficult threshold.",

        "message": "@davidavdav I agree that loading data is a difficult and important thing. However, it is a domain-specific problem. You have a particular type of data. I have another. My data is medical images of brain activity. I can tell you how I organize my data and load them. I can even tell you that we have written a whole package about this, with its own documentation. But that will probably not help you.\nWhat you want is something that tells you how to organize and load _your_ data. Now, it may be that your data is something fairly classic, that many people have; for instance tabular data most often stored in CSV files. In which case there is a need for a package doing this data loading. I don't believe that it should be in scikit-learn. It needs to be in a package that is specialized for this data. For instance, we are not going to put image processing in scikit-learn. For tabular data, the dedicated package is pandas; as I mentioned in my reply we need to point to it. We, the scikit-learn team, want to make plugin pandas into scikit-learn easier. But it is not as easy as it may seem and it takes time (one of our core devs is prototyping something).\nI realize rereading your post that your data is most likely text documents. So my two examples of data (medical images and tabular data) were both wrong :$. Maybe the documentation on processing text with scikit-learn could indeed be improved and touch a bit on data organization. I don't know, I very seldom process text. But if you want to do add a few words on this, you are most welcomed to do a pull request. Anyhow, this illustrate my point about the diversity of the data: this whole thread is mostly about loading CSV files, as can be seen from earlier comments (before the thread exploded into a rant). The important thing is not the \"CSV\", which is the container, but the data model that underlies a CSV file. This data model is that of columns of data with different nature. It's a very different data model than processing text documents.\nAnd finally, you are unhappy that teaching people \"how to import your data\" is time consuming. I don't think that there is an easy fix for this, even in a specific domain. The reason being that data meaning (ie data semantics) is still very much an open area. It's intrinsically hard to describe what the data means and how it's organized. You can try a simple experience: grab a dataset from someone you don't know, about an experiment you don't know, and try understanding it. Not even loading it, just understanding it. I am sure that it will take time. What takes a human time tends to be very difficult for a computer.",

Instead, you can do the below.\n# Steps to get a specific box at a specific version without using `vagrant` to perform the download\nI'm using laravel/homestead in this example because it's what I was trying to get.\n1. Download the box using a better download client (e.g. your browser, curl, wget, whatever).\n2. Create a new json file (anywhere), add this to it (note, tweak the `name`, `version` and `url` keys to match the box you want, don't worry about the `checksum` key yet. For `url`, use the path to the file you just downloaded, example below):\n```\n{\n\"name\": \"laravel/homestead\",\n\"description\": \"Whatever you want\",\n\"versions\": [{\n\"version\": \"4.0.0\",\n\"providers\": [{\n\"name\": \"virtualbox\",\n\"url\": \"file://c:/users/madmatt/Downloads/47dce273-9892-4691-a746-c4f351ae44a5\",\n\"checksum_type\": \"sha1\",\n\"checksum\": \"abc123\"\n}]\n}]\n}\n```\n3. In your `Vagrantfile`, add the following lines `vm.box` and `vm.box_url` keys):\n```\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\nconfig.vm.box = \"laravel/homestead\"\nconfig.vm.box_url = \"file://c:/users/madmatt/path/to/the/json-file-you-created-in-step-2.json\"\nend\n```\n4. Run `vagrant up` as normal.\n5. `vagrant` will complain that the sha hash doesn't match (`The checksum of the downloaded box did not match...`). Take the string that appears next to 'Expected', copy and paste that into the `checksum` key of the json file you created in step 2.\n6. Run `vagrant up` again, this time it should load from the local file, store it as the correct name and version, and successfully run it.\nHopefully someone finds these steps useful... funnily enough I have done all this research (having never used vagrant before), have tested it a bunch of times, and the original `vagrant box add laravel/homestead` command that I started running 3 hours ago is still only 8% complete, even though in that time I've downloaded the box file 8 times outside of vagrant.\nThe rest of this is just my experience, no need to read further ;)\n# My experience (aka. why is vagrant so slow to download boxes)\nWas getting 420b/sec (yes, that's bytes per second) on a gigabit connection downloading https://vagrantcloud.com/laravel/boxes/homestead/versions/4.0.0/providers/virtualbox.box.\nI downloaded the same file via browser, curl and wget with speeds varying between 12 and 27MB/sec. I then tried doing both at the same time - I was able to download via Chrome, Firefox, curl and wget before ```vagrant box add laravel/homestead``` had downloaded 1%.\nThe URL I got in the browser was ```https://vagrantcloud-files-production.s3.amazonaws.com/archivist/boxes/47dce273-9892-4691-a746-c4f351ae44a5?X-Amz-Algorithm=<snip>&X-Amz-Credential=<snip>&X-Amz-Date=<snip>&X-Amz-Expires=<snip>&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=<snip>&X-Amz-Signature=<snip>```\nI don't know what the problem here is, but I can think of a couple:\n* Whatever UA vagrant uses is bad, and AWS severely limits it\n* Whatever vagrant uses to download isn't following redirects, or somehow never ends up downloading from AWS infrastructure, instead using some other terribly overloaded server/proxy",

In many cases the box being downloaded is located on a third party system. One feature that was introduced in Vagrant a couple releases ago was the notification of redirect to show when boxes are being downloaded from a third party server.\nThere have also been claims that the embedded curl is downloading files slower than the system curl. I have not been successful in validating this claim and do not see a difference in download speed between my system curl and the embedded curl. However, as of Vagrant 2.0.4, the [`VAGRANT_PREFER_SYSTEM_BINS`](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/other/environmental-variables.html#vagrant_prefer_system_bin) environment variable is available for all platforms. When enabled, Vagrant will use local system binaries if available instead of the embedded binaries. If you observe faster download speeds with your local curl binary, this provides a switch to easily enable Vagrant to use the local binary.\nMy apologies for the frustration this issue has caused. It is something I have investigated multiple times, but the number of variables involved makes this extremely difficult to get a valid reproduction. I have updated Vagrant's functionality to make the underlying cause more easily understandable where available (redirect notifications) or easier to work around. I am continuing to investigate our options for box downloads from Vagrant Cloud in different regions of the world (which have occasionally presented with issues). However, with box downloads from third party locations, there is little I am able to do to control their available bandwidth or any kind of throttling they may impose.\nCheers!",

It seems like that should constitute a usage for the purpose of variance inference, since it implies a variance bound: `Elem` must be invariant since `AsSlice`'s parameter is invariant.\nIn Scala for example, the equivalent would be `class Foo[E, S <: Seq[E]](val seq: S)`. Scala doesn't infer variance, but it \"knows\" that `E` must be covariant or invariant. If we try to make it contravariant (with `-E`), we get `error: contravariant type E occurs in covariant position`.\nIf getting the compiler to recognize these variance bounds would be complicated, perhaps lifetime and non-lifetime parameters could be handled differently? As the RFC notes, only lifetimes have subtype relationships, so it seems like non-lifetime parameters might as well be \"inherently\" invariant, and not subject to inference. Code like `struct Thing<'a, 'b: 'a>(&'b u32);` would continue to be rejected, but I don't think there's any \"legitimate\" reason to write lifetime parameters like that.",

You demonstrate a lack of understanding of what actually makes a package manager have \"secure\" releases. A secure release is signed with a private key that only you would have. At the moment anyone can get into your Github user and commit anything they want to your project. Sure you can revert it once you get your account back but until then damage can be done.\nYour hashes mean nothing. Anyone can edit your website and edit those hashes anytime they want. None of what you mentioned gives increased security.\nI also have a 10+ year old ORM with hundreds of projects and more then a decade of maturity. But you know what? Nobody cares.\nIf you have no code coverage report your tests mean nothing.\nNever use oauth? lmao. The company I work for. Literally our entire business model depends on APIs that use oauth. I have no choice. It's not like oh lemme just make my own Fitness tracker real quick.\nThis entire thread can be summed up as \"I made up my mind 10 years ago and I don't feel like learning anything new so leave me alone\".",

Not to mention that you seem to be advocating in favor of antivirus/anti-spyware. In a sane computing environment, a black-box proprietary software made by a for-profit corporation running with administrative privileges (aka \"\"\"antivirus\"\"\") is not considered a layer of security.

You can't just claim something and ask others to disprove it. Start by defining what is \"too common\". 30% of torrents? 40%? 50%? In which sites? The burden of proof lies with you.

All progress is about change, not about doing the same thing all over. Do you have an iPhone? Think about why they are so popular.

If the lines are too thin, they can be made bigger. This is again not the point. I am also not against end caps in principle, as shown in the paper cited initially. The end caps alone (without a bar) are very useful to indicate a secondary uncertainty, typically a systematic uncertainty, in addition to a statistical uncertainty indicated by the error bar.\nThe default changes are a great chance for matplotlib to go forward.

The cap contains the complete information, namely how big the uncertainty is. The error line itself contains no information whatsoever. It is solely a guide to the eye, to find the end more easily. What I really want to use this answer for, is to strongly emphasis that the defaults should not focus on making nice looking plots but unambiguous ones. Aesthetics is to a certain point always up to the beholder, and he is encouraged to change the design in a way he finds pleasing. However, wrong information should never be conveyed. That is why it was so important to change the default color map. This belongs to me in the same category.\nThe plot I showed was exactly such an example (and it is a real-life example). I tried different algorithms and suddenly my plot showed me that algorithm 1 is orders of magnitude better, as there was no more visible error in comparison to plot 2. You can now say, just change the design how you like it. But that just makes it even more dangerous for me, as I might forget about the terrible choice matplotlib does. I go to a different machine and might do the same error again and might lose a workday if I am not careful.\nThus, I just plead, focus that the plots represent the information. What you do afterwards to make the plots look better doesn't bother me. If I want a good-looking plot, I will change it anyway.

Otherwise (currently!) you get an empty, invalid value object that has non-nullable properties set to `null`. IMHO, the current implementation is broken here.\n- when all `@Column` in the Embeddable are nullable, there should be a boolean setting in the `@Embedded` annotation that controls whether or not you want an empty value object or a `null` value when all fields are `null` in the database. **Your choice**.\nFinally, you only have a real problem when you have a fully nullable embeddable, **and** want to make the distinction between a `null` property and an empty object. People have suggested to add an extra column in the table, which would work, but would add a ton of complexity for what I think is an edge case. To clarify, **I think this edge case should not be supported by Doctrine**.\nThe previous two bullet points, however, **I would strongly suggest working on them ASAP**.

Pull requests like that take time to review and evaluate. I'm not trying to make excuses for other people here, I'm just hoping you can bear with the people maintaining it. That said, there is currently a development push going for 3.0, so maybe there's an opportunity to get those pull requests merged.\nOpen source projects need contributors to move forward and evolve, especially when maintainers have little or in some cases no time for the project. However, writing pull requests is just a small part of that work - most of it is looking at issues, figuring out what's going on, evaluating pull requests and making sure your user base is not going to burn you at the stake because you messed up.

OSX is the outlier, and it's because of the combinatorial explosions of configuration options, along with the fact that Apple has decided to deliver xcode (and xcode update) configurations that are hostile to developers maintaining non-trivial C extensions.\nI'm not sure what outcome you're hoping to achieve with an approach like the above -- rude, disrespectful, entitled -- but watch and hopefully learn as I treat you with more respect than you've treated Nokogiri maintainers.\nWe believe at this point that the installation tutorial:\n```\nhttp://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html\n```\nworks for nearly all known configurations of OSX. Did you go through the tutorial and follow all the steps for OSX? If so, that would be useful information to note when opening a support request. If not, help me understand how we can better point people like you at that tutorial? In particular, the xcode bit is really required for Mac users at this point.\nIf the tutorial doesn't address the problem you're having, then please make sure you provide both the output from `gem install` and also the `mkmf.log` file.\nI'll further note that above, you've tried to install three different versions of Nokogiri. I'll also point out that you've got permissions errors even when you sudo, which makes me think you've either got a really weirdly configured system, or else you're trolling.\n---\nI'd like to note that the Nokogiri Code of Conduct\n```\nhttps://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n```\nasks everyone to be nice and reminds you that Nokogiri maintainers are volunteers, who don't get paid to work on it, and have personal lives and families. Your approach in this issue is offensive and rude, and in all honesty represents most of what I dislike about being an open source maintainer. You expect something for nothing, and heap abuse on volunteers who have spent hundreds of thankless hours working to get Nokogiri to work on OSX.\nIf you've surmounted your personal communication and anger-management challenges and read this far, I'll ask that if you go through the installation tutorial and it doesn't address the problem you're having, that you open a new issue and respectfully provide enough information to help a maintainer diagnose the issue on your particular system.\nI'll be locking this issue both because your request violates the CoC, but also just to preserve Yet Another Disrespectful Request for posterity, and so that when I finally get fed up and ragequit open source, I'll have plenty of interesting Github Issues to point people at.\nFinally -- everyone in the Ruby community who saw this issue come in and didn't do anything to police it -- you're part of the problem, too. For every open-source maintainer who quits, y'all wring your hands and are full of regret; but these are the opportunities you miss to prevent that from happening. A community that doesn't police rudeness and disrepect is not a community I'm happy to be a part of.\n---\n@SUzB - sorry you got caught in the crossfire on this, but you've also made a very unconstructive post wherein the OP claims a problem and shows three very different logs for three different versions of Nokogiri, and you say, \"I am facing the same issue.\" No, no you're not.\nPlease feel free to open a new issue providing enough information for us to diagnose your issue. At the very least, info about your OS, and if you're OSX then we'll need to know more about xcode and will need to see your logs.",

        "message": "I needed a global install of NVM because I have some node based cron jobs and a few legacy applications that are rather picky about which version of node they are able to work on. For a time I worked around this by sourcing the nvm script everywhere but that seems to be a somewhat unmaintainable solution. The requirements I have:\n- NVM should just work in non-interactive sessions\n- Every user should be able to select a installed version of node (or use ```$ nvm exec```)\n- Some users should be able to install newer versions of node\nThis is the solution I came up with: (shout out to @icecoldphp, for the initial version)\n0. I've done this on a debian 8 machine, as the root user\n1. Create a group called \"nvm\", ```# groupadd nvm```\n2. Add root to the nvm group ```# usermod -aG nvm root```\n3. Goto the ```/opt``` directory and create a directory called nvm - Make sure the groupd owner is nvm ```# chown :nvm ./nvm```\n- Set the permissions so that the group is allowed to write in there and all file will inherit the group ```# chmod g+ws ./nvm```\n4. Follow the [git install](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#git-install) steps using ```/opt/nvm``` as the directory - To make sure the group can also write aliases, cache downloads and install global packages make sure the directories exist and have the correct permissions:\n```\n# mkdir /opt/nvm/.cache\n# mkdir /opt/nvm/versions\n# mkdir /opt/nvm/alias # chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/.cache\n# chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/versions\n# chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/alias\n```\n5. Using the following snippet create ```/etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```:\n```#/etc/profile.d/nvm.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nexport NVM_DIR=\"/opt/nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && . \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"\n```\n6. Ensure that the script is executable ```# chmod +x /etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```\n7. If you want to use nvm in non-interactive sessions as well make sure to source the nvm file in ```/etc/bash.bashrc``` before the line saying ```# If not running interactively, don't do anything``` by adding ```. /etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```.\n8. For bash completion (which is inherently interactive ;) add ```[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"``` after the section about bash completion.\nEvery user can select a version of node (as the permissions for public are ```r-x```) and users in the nvm group can install and remove versions of node (permissions for the group are ```rwx```).\nMy questions are:\n- As a developer I know next to nothing about linux, could this be improved, is it bad style, etc? Any feedback is welcome.\n- Should this be documented in the NVM README.md?",

However, there are some areas where the instructions can potentially lead to confusion or errors if not followed correctly:*  1) It assumes that all users have root access as it suggests adding 'root' into a group and changing permissions without considering non-privileged user scenarios which might be inappropriate for less experienced system administrators. This could cause issues, especially on systems where the current owner of the machine is not the root or does not hold administrative privileges.*  2) The instructions do not account for potential permission errors that may arise when changing ownership and permissions to directories like 'nvm' which might require superuser access (sudo).*   3) It assumes a specific Linux distribution without specifying it, making this guide less universal. Not all systems have the same file paths or commands available.*  4) The instructions do not include error handling for cases where these operations may fail due to permissions issues or other system-specific quirks which could lead to frustration if users encounter problems during installation and setup."

If I install a binary on a machine it's expected that the binary is available to the entire system. Not just a single user. If I install ffmpeg on a machine I expect that I can run ffmpeg from my terminal but also from any running process. Expecting a process to source a bash script for every binary is madness. If everyone followed your paradigm the *nix eco system would be way worse off.\nHere's [documentation](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/dirstructure.html) on BSD directory structure. Here's a [pretty good discussion](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11544/what-is-the-difference-between-opt-and-usr-local) on where user level packages should be installed. Sadly nvm follows none of these well documented installation paradigms. If you did we wouldn't be having this discussion.\nFurthermore if there are actually two users on a machine that need to use nvm you are duplicating binaries on-disk for each user for absolutely no reason. You could easily store them globally and link them to the user's home directory should you choose to continue to use your existing directory structure. My nvm folder on my Macbook Pro is already 479M with only two versions of node. If I told every developer to install node via nvm for every user I'd be looking at gigabytes of files on-disk for absolutely no reason. I tend to like efficiency and this is not it.\nThe only reason people use nvm is because node's release schedule is very rapid and apt, yum, brew, and other built in system package managers choose to not update fast enough. For this reason you have people using nvm even though they need node installed globally on a machine.\nWhich brings me to my next point: node is a run-time binary for running Javascript code. A run-time _should_ be installed globally. This is how literally every single run-time works.\nBy default when someone claims to have a piece of software that is a \"version manager\" I would expect it to do that on my system, not just within my bash terminal.\nYou might as well change the description of this project to:\n> Node Version Manager - Simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions (for the current terminal user in bash compatible shells only).\nYou have multiple people in this thread asking for this and you claim that nvm isn't designed for this. Which is odd since nvm is obviously downloading node to a directory on the user's machine and managing directory links and aliases for them. Having it be global is a tiny additional feature on top of what you already have. You could simply soft link the directory where node is installed to /usr/local/ and be good to go (if root).\nFinally for security reasons Linux [explicitly supports users](https://www.tecmint.com/add-users-in-linux/) (section 6) without a home directory. A common one in Ubuntu is `www-data` for web servers. In this thread you are explicitly saying you won't support this completely valid use case.\nI'm not trying to be mean or passive aggressive.

The same happens on mobile devices my app is ported to (android/iOS).\nI'm running Windows 10 Pro 64 bit\n1. I'm adding a marker to the map and I want to affect its ordering by zIndex means:\n`var marker = new L.Marker(location,\n{\nicon: new L.Icon(\n{\niconUrl: iconUrl,\niconSize: [size.width, size.height],\niconAnchor: [anchor.leftOffset, anchor.topOffset]\n}),\ndraggable: draggable,\nclickable: true,\nzIndexOffset: zIndexOffset\n});`\nIn my example I'm using zIndexOffset of 202.\n2. After adding the marker to the map (marker.addTo(map)) immediately I see that the marker object changes and get a zIndex of 619. Actually each application run with the same initial zIndexOffset I get a different zIndex on marker object after adding it to the map.\n3. I have an event listener on 'mousedown' event and when I inspect the marker object received by the listener zIndex is again different (477). Meaning it has changed even from the arbitrary value set in setp 2.\n4. In case I zoom in and out the map the zIndex will change again.\nAll of this doesn't allow me to set different markers on top of others since step 2 change ruins any logic I may use in my code.\nHere's the example of what happens in the [leaflet playground](http://playground-leaflet.rhcloud.com/gexa/edit?html,console,output):\nHow could this be fixed or maybe any workaround?\nThanks in advance",

The `zIndex` of each marker depends on the *vertical coordinate of the marker*. Look at this screenshot from https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.Icon.Glyph:\n![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/09ba35cbec1a15aaf2a599be333a85d701f69ead/68747470733a2f2f6c6561666c65742e6769746875622e696f2f4c6561666c65742e49636f6e2e476c7970682f64656d6f2e706e67)\nDo you see how you can only see the tip of the bottom-most markers? That's because the `zIndex` of the markers in the bottom row is greater than in the second row, which have a `zIndex` greater than those in the third row, and so on. The `zIndex` is not arbitrary. It grows by 1 for every pixel down. It also gets recalculated on zooming and some view resets.\nThus, the zIndex**Offset** option is an **offset** which applies to the seemingly arbitrary `zIndex`. Thus, if I wanted the center marker to be on top of the rest, I'd set a `zIndexOffset` of at least the height of a marker, and it would look like:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1125786/27128107-a2a6bbb4-50fd-11e7-8244-12efd37cc3d3.png)\n> All of this doesn't allow me to set different markers on top of others since step 2 change ruins any logic I may use in my code.\n> Here's the example of what happens in the leaflet playground:\nIf the problem is that you can't set which marker goes on top, *show me an example of how that fails*, because that playground only logs a value, it does not show me markers failing to display on top of other markers.

We do know that some browsers have a limit on integer CSS properties of 2^23 (see https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/commit/c5172f3088b820325e726f57f0b09b16b1ec498d, https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/commit/17c180e1eff97932c3450447d5d17fda199f7c2c), but `zIndex`es have never been a big problem, because Leaflet recalculates them once in a while on every `viewreset`, so the values for both the CSS transforms and the `zIndex`es are within a manageable range.\nIn my experience, it's better to learn about the [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/Stacking_without_z-index) than to be afraid of misusing `z-index`.\n> That's the point that in case I could have managed the actual zIndex of markers on the map it would solve everything [...]\nNo you wouldn't, because if you're not resetting the `zIndex`es of the markers which transition from active to inactive, you would end up with the same problem.\nI mean, if you want to *really* try if your logic would work without Leaflet's management of `zIndex`/`zIndexOffset`, you can manually disable it with something like\n```js\nL.Marker.prototype._updateZIndex = function(offset) {\n// this._icon.style.zIndex = this._zIndex + offset;\n}\n```\nSo far, you've been subtly suggesting that Leaflet is the culprit and that your logic is infallible. [Programmers like myself don't react well to this kind of bug reporting](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html#symptoms).

That probably makes the most sense for 'view'.\nFor 'decrypt' and especially 'edit', I'm not sure that will be sufficient. For 'edit', the re-encrypt phrase is going to need to be able to figure out which variable values originally came from a vaulted value. Especially if the file is edited significantly (reordering lines for example, or changing the variable name). So the file presented for editing would need to include some markers indicating the text that was decrypted/should be re-encrypted. A couple of ways to do that:\n1) Add comments to mark the text, and doing some text manipulation/regexes to replace it with encrypted text in place. Something like:\n``` yaml\n# START VAULT PLAINTEXT - my_var\nmy_var: my text goes here\n# END VAULT PLAINTEXT - my_var\nsome_plain_var: blippy\n```\n2) Add a new yaml type indicating text to be encrypted. Something like:\n``` yaml\nmy_var: !vault-plaintext |\nmy text goes here\nsome_plain_var: blippy\n```\nIt would be best if we could yaml parse the input, decrypt the value, serialize the yaml to a file for editing, let user edit it, then yaml parse the results, encrypt the value, and serialize to yaml and save.\nBut... doing that with the available yaml parser would lose comments and ordering of maps.\nSo likely some in place string/text manipulations will be required.",

Because of that I think we're going to be sooner or later again in a stupid situation where Jinja 4.0 would need to be named \"Jinja4\" on pypi.\nSo I think while this rename is somewhat okay I generally don't think anymore that it's a good idea.

As a concept it does have benefits of reuse, but it also carries downsides of maintenance overhead, complicated abstraction layers, difficult testability, side effects and surprises in behavioural changes... These days stateless interface-based implementations have become quite popular (especially with raise of functional languages) where each class has a single responsibility (or as close to that as possible) and gets all the dependencies injected via a constructor. This allows to write much cleaner and maintainable code, easier to unit test (as opposed to inheritance based classes where you would more likely be writing integration tests) and easier to alter behavior by substituting dependencies.\nAnother benefit of using interface-based architecture that you could plug in IoC container (e.g. autofac).\nOver the years I have experience both sides, I was a big proponent of OOP but I have learnt the hard way that it makes it much harder to maintain such code, especially in large projects.\nAs I observed, a lot of bugs stem from implementations with overloaded concerns and lack of unit tests. As a result the code is quite confusing, inflexible and hard maintain.\nIn my opinion, one of the ways we could start reducing the tech debt and improving the codebase - start extracting separate concerns into individual classes and compose them as required.

Mocks have a strong tendency to deviate from the documented pre- and post-conditions of the original interfaces\nI am not sure if completely I understand your point.\nIf each class has a single responsibility (SR), then DI should not add any ambiguity - for each use case you set dependencies to imitate boundary conditions, but you **only** exercise and validate functionality of the class under test.\nAny changes to dependencies should not have any profound effect because the class is built against a contract and not a particular implementation. Certainly a degree of coupling is possible, but it typically it will be lose coupling.\nAlso a SR class (usually) define a limited number of methods (accessible via an interface). As a result you test the public surface. Generally there is a limited need to test internal or private methods (due to their absence).\nAnother benefit of smaller classes with SR - you know exactly what each class depends on. For example right now `GitModule` spans across 3,400+ lines of code carrying hundreds of methods. And we inject this monstrosity to classes which may need to access only one method from the lot...\nIf a class has multiple responsibilities and/or initialises its own concrete dependencies then it is virtually impossible to perform unit testing - instead you will be writing integration tests. Any changes to dependencies with high degree of probability will necessitate changes to the class, because there is a tight coupling to concrete implementations.\nWrt: code coverage - whilst it is a very useful metric, it shouldn't be viewed as an absolute. 100% CC can be very misleading.\nPersonally when I write tests I usually strive for 100% coverage taking in consideration various edge cases.

Which breaks SR principle.\nI prefer to describe tests as \"fast\"/\"slow\", or as \"stable\"/\"unstable\". A test as I described would be characterized as \"fast\", \"stable\", and also particularly well-suited to detecting regressions related to a specific scenario. When you start describing tests as \"unit\" or \"integration\", it's easy to lose sight of the fundamental purpose of testing.\nThe fundamental purpose of testing is to detect cases where the observable behavior of an application deviates from the expected behavior for some user scenario. I find this condition is reasonably relaxed to detecting changes in behavior under a theoretically-reachable scenario.\n\"Unit\" tests are a sub-optimal approximation of this that resulted from several limitations:\n1. It is difficult for developers to reason about the line-level behavior of high-level testing.\n1. Code coverage tooling was incomplete and/or slow, such that it was not practical to adopt as part of a team code review process.\n1. High-level testing tends to be slow, unreliable, and/or difficult to stand up (e.g. only runs under a specific non-standard system configuration, or requires specialized software installations).\nCode coverage tooling now performs very well, and eliminates the problems typically associated with the first item. We found that by moving away from \"unit tests\" as a goal, we were able to write tests that better represented reality. The focus instead was on test speed, stability, and independence from system configuration. The result was something between what would normally be classified as \"unit\" or \"integration\" tests - we used fakes\u00b9 to eliminate external dependencies, and tested primarily against well-defined module boundaries\u00b2. When possible, we fed inputs to the application in the same way it would actually occur for a user:\n1. When testing the behavior of a subsystem, we tested using the same API that other code would be using to drive that subsystem. Code which we *couldn't* cover with this approach often meant the code was dead code under real-world conditions.\n1. When testing UI controls, we actually created the control and interacted with it as a user would (yes this can be fast and reliable).\n1. When testing file system, we created files and folders and tested against them. We used ACLs or chmod to force access errors and held handles open to force sharing violations.\n\u00b9 Typically stub executables or our own implementations of interfaces in code\n\u00b2 We applied a `[ServiceInterface]` attribute to the boundary interface, which carried special requirements. These interfaces were required to be threading agnostic, safe for concurrent use without regard for the caller (new unknown callers could appear at will), idempotent, and only ever obtained from the single service container instance. Mocking was *forbidden* for any object which was not marked with `[ServiceInterface]`. For cases where one or more of these conditions could not be met, we used `[ServiceInterface(Restricted = true)]`, and required that the restriction (often a limitation on who is allowed to call it) be documented - use of this form was seen as technical debt, but used occasionally because the correct solution was too costly at the time.",

Like yours my position comes from practical experience solving real engineering challenges.\nI'm part of a small team building RAD framework and reusable components where pretty much every component can be substituted by a consumer. We have a number of major and minor releases concurrently powering hundreds of apps in production, and we provide full runtime backwards compatibility.\nWe can assume very little about consumers, their habits and requirements. In turn we must provide a great deal of flexibility but ensure stability of the framework core and consumer applications (to a degree). This is specifically important in security-related areas.\nAll of this dictates how we architect and engineer the framework, how we deal with dependencies, how we deploy and how we test.\nUntil we re-engineered the codebase to consist of interface based stateless single responsibility classes we had a number of challenges meeting the requirements (including production incidents). We also couldn't reason about stability and predictability of provided behaviors.\nNow we have 1,800+ .NET unit tests, hundreds of JS tests and probably another few thousand of BDD tests. Some tests, especially security-related, test the order of execution - without that we can't reason about predictability, nor we can release new versions or provide backwards compatibility.\nSmaller interface-based single responsibility implementations allow us to achieve * isolation (all dependencies are injected), * testability (all dependencies are mocked), * stability (via predictability), * flexibility (consumers only concern themselves with replacing a specific implementation instead of worrying about inter-dependencies).

        "message": "@RussKie Your last post really resonates with me. One of the goals I had when I was pushing so hard to switch away from mocks (on a former project) was based on the type of application being shipped to customers. As you are well aware, anything considered public API surface area has special requirements related to versioning. These requirements constrain the development team substantially, but are a great asset from the customers perspective. However, in an application where the final product is the application (as opposed to a publicly-consumable API), these same requirements *burden* the development team. I didn't like the fact that when we wanted to make a change to our implementation, we kept running into pain points (leading to delays) resembling those faced by developers trying to make changes to public APIs.\nAnother application (this time a library) I've contributed to over time is StringTemplate. While it has a few known extension points built in, it was never designed to be arbitrarily reconfigurable for end users. Over time it's led to a frustrating experience for a small subset of users trying to do arguably normal things, just things we didn't think of from the start. For example, by failing to abstract the file system (location and reading) away from the template loader, it's not possible to use *some* features of StringTemplate when the templates are stored e.g. in a database, or stored using a compression mechanism we didn't think of from the start. Better adherence to SRP would likely improve the long term durability and flexibility of this library.\nIt sounds to me like GitExtensions is unlikely to suffer from most of the problems related to reusable components, and more likely to benefit from a testing approach that focuses on application behavior.\n> > When testing UI controls, we actually created the control and interacted with it as a user would (yes this can be fast and reliable).\n>\n> @sharwell Is there any publicly available project that uses this approach - I would love to see this in action.\nNot to the extent of the one I've been referring to. I've started to add tests for UI related bug reports to PerfView, but these are quite limited and not particularly elegant currently.\nWhen I built a system like this in the past, I started with the following:\n1. Identify all mutable static state in the application. We will need a way to reset these to known default values between each test, ensuring that the outcome of any given test cannot influence the behavior of another (with a corollary that a test failure uniquely and deterministically identifies the culprit, which can then be executed in isolation to reproduce the failure):\n* Mutable `static` fields\n* File read and written\n* Registry keys/values read/written\n2. Identify all asynchronous operations. We will need a way to ensure that a test is not considered complete while one of these is executing (or scheduled for later execution, in the case of timers or delays).\n3. Identify external dependencies for which the concrete implementation is likely problematic for high-speed deterministic testing. We will need a way to substitute the behavior of these items during testing. The method of substitution must guarantee that during the execution of any given test, all executing code is using the same implementation (either the original or the substituted one, but never a mix and never multiple substitutes).\n* One obvious case is invocations of *git.exe* for many types of tests\n* Loading resources from a network\nOnce you address the above, most tests are still written against module interface boundaries. However, when actually testing UI behaviors it's not particularly challenging to write those tests against the controls. Most of the problems typically associated with testing UI behavior are really just failures to address one of the above underlying concerns.",

I don't need unit tests, I need the app to be thoroughly tested. I expressed my needs here https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/pull/3898#issuecomment-322384024\nI don't want to say that asserting on implementation is always wrong. It can be helpful, but it should not be overused. I think it should be strictly limited and explicitly described when it can be used. I see to many corner cases in my mind when unit tests asserting on implementation go green and the app is not working as expected. There are even more cases I see when changing the implementation turns such unit tests into red ones. These of many assertions in a single test are the most likely to fail and the hardest to correct (I am ignoring here the fact that we should not have to correct tests for which the pre and post conditions have not changed). I don't mind writing tests that ensure a developer well understand description of the used interfaces and its operations. For example when resetting unstaged changes, I prefer to have a set of tests like:\n1. Ensure staged files are untouched\n2. Ensure ignored files are untouched\n3. etc.\nto have a test like:\n1. Ensure the `git reset --hard` is executed.\n>>The order of execution and the content of execution is subject of change in contrast to the expected behavior.\n>This is a contradictory statement - the order of execution is one of the key factors for expected behaviour. And the content of execution should not matter at all.\nPerhaps my English skills are too poor to express it correctly. I prefer to verify that the chosen by a developer sequence of execution leads to the expected state than to verify that the chosen by a developer sequence of execution is the sequence he chose.

I am hesitant to encourage too many hacks to resolution logic, which is already complicated and difficult to debug.\n@brettdh I think I can shed some light because you have most of the pieces. `pipenv lock` doesn't install anything, and it doesn't claim to. It only generates the lockfile given your host environment, python version, and a provided `Pipfile`. If you manipulate your environment in some other way or if you use pip directly/manipulate pip settings outside of pipenv / are not using `pipenv run` or using `pip freeze` inside a pipenv subshell, it is quite easy for a lockfile to be out of sync from `pip freeze`. The two aren't really related.\nTo be clear:\n1. `Pipfile.lock` is a strictly-pinned dependency resolution using the pip-tools resolver based on the user's `Pipfile`\n2. If you want to maintain strict pins of everything while upgrading only one package, I believe you can do this by strictly pinning everything in your `Pipfile` except for the one thing you want to upgrade (correct me if I'm wrong @vphilippon)\nAs for your lockfile and `pip freeze` disagreeing with one another, I'd have to know more information, but I believe we have an open issue regarding our lockfile resolver when using non-system versions of python to resolve.",

Its handled by `pip-tools` (or rather, a patched version of it, integrated in a special way by `pipenv` that bring a few differences with the original tool). In short, the locking mechanism reads the `Pipfile` and performs a full dependency resolution to select a full set of package that will meet *every* constraints defined by the required packages *and their dependencies*.\n@techalchemy > [...] it\u2019s resolving with pip-tools that concerns me.\nI'm not sure how those `--upgrade-strategy` would affect `pip-tools`, because it works on some low-level internals of `pip`. I have the feeling this would not give the expected result, as these option take into account what's installed, and that's not what's being dealt with in that mechanism. But we have another approach to this in `pip-tools` that could be done here.\nThe \"original\" `pip-tools` behavior is that it only updates what's is needed in the lockfile (in its context, its the requirements.txt), but this was \"lost\" in the way the resolver was integrated in `pipenv`. Let me explain why.\nPointing back to my resume of how `pip-tools` works: https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/issues/875#issuecomment-337717817\nRemember the \"select a candidate\" part? That's done by querying the `Repository` object.\nIn `pipenv`, we directly configure a `PyPIRepository` for the `Resolver`, but `pip-tools` does something else, it uses a `LocalRequirementsRepository` object, which keeps the existing pins from the previously existing `requirements.txt` (if found), and \"fallbacks\" on `PyPIRepository`.\nSo in `pip-tools`, the following happens when selecting a candidate:\n1. Query `LocalRequirementsRepository` for a candidate that match `foobar>=1.0,<2.0`.\n1. Check if an existing pin meets that requirements:\n- If yes, return that pin as the candidate.\n- If not, query the `proxied_repository` (`PyPIRepository`) for the candidate.\n1. Use the candidate returned\nEffectively, it means that existing pins are given a \"priority\" as candidate to try first.\nBut in `pipenv`, currently, it simply:\n1. Query `PyPIRepository` (directly) for a candidate that match `foobar>=1.0,<2.0`.\n1. Use the candidate returned.\nSo, I think the same behavior for the locking in `pipenv` could be done by parsing the `Pipfile.lock` to get the existing pins and use a `LocalRequirementsRepository`, like `pip-tools` does in its `pip-compile` command.",

We need a set of `InstallRequirements` that represents the pins in the `Pipfile.lock`.\n- Using `LocalRequirementsRepository`: Fairly easy: change our current `PyPIRepository` for a `LocalRequirementsRepository`.\n---------------\nBut, as I'm looking into this, and following @brettdh comments, I realize a few things:\n1. The current default `pipenv install` behavior doesn't match the `pipenv lock` behavior. Doing `pipenv install requests` alone won't update `requests` if a new version comes out (much like straight `pip install`). However, doing `pipenv lock` will update the `Pipfile.lock` with the latest version of `requests` that matches the `Pipfile` specifier, and the dependency constraints.\nThere's 2 main way to see this:\n- A) The `Pipfile.lock` should stay as stable as possible by default, not changing pins unless required, in order to stay like the current environment, and only change in the event that we change the environment.\n- B) The `Pipfile.lock` should get the newest versions that respect the environment constrains/dependencies in order to freely benefit from the open ranges in the `Pipfile` and lib dependencies, allowing to continuously acquire new compatible versions in your environment. You can then run `pipenv update` to benefit from the fresh lock.\nIMHO, I would align the default behavior, which would be to go with A) by default. Because right now, everytime a lock is performed (i.e. after each installation), new versions can come in, which make the lockfile *drive the update of the environment*, which seems weird. But, this is arguable of course. While in development, I might want to continuously update my requirements to no get stale, like with B), so that should also be easily doable.\n2. Even if we use `LocalRequirementsRepository` to avoid updating correct existing pins, and end up aligning the default behaviors, we then need to address the equivalent of `--upgrade` and `--upgrade-strategy` for the locking part. Currently, defining some environment variable (like `PIP_UPGRADE` and `PIP_UPGRADE_STRATEGY`) will affect the `pipenv install` behavior, but will not affect `pipenv lock`, as it doesn't affect the behavior of `pip-tools` (I confirmed that, as I was unsure at first).\nOtherwise, there will be no way to update the environment without either deleting the `Pipfile.lock` (feels clunky, and \"all or nothing\") or *requiring* a newer version (I mean doing an explicit `pipenv install requests>2.18.4`, which requires you to *know* that a new version is out, and changes the specifier in the `Pipfile` itself, increasing the lower bound), which is wrong. As the \"original `pip-tools`\" doesn't deffer to `pip` to deal with this (as it's not related that what is currently installed), it offers an option to specify the dependencies to update in the lockfile, and simply remove the pins for these packages (or all) from the existing_pins list, effectively falling back to querying PyPI. I'm not sure how we can match the notion of \"--upgrade-strategy\" with this.\n---------------\n@techalchemy So while I was saying it was fairly easy to just \"align the default behavior\", I now realize that this would cause some major issue with being able to update the packages (as in: just fetch the latest version that match my current constraints).\nIf there's something unclear, ask away, a lot of editing went on when writing this.\n(Dependency resolution is not easy.

Some of your phrasing around B confused me a bit, though, seeming to say that `pipenv lock` might result in a lockfile that doesn't actually match the environment - I particularly heard this in that one would need to \"run `pipenv update` to benefit from the fresh lock\" - as if the lock is \"ahead\" of the environment rather than matching it.\nRegardless of whether you are in an A workflow or a B workflow, a few things seem constant to me, and I think this squares with what @techalchemy is saying as well:\n* The result of `pipenv lock` should always be a lockfile that matches the environment.\n* The result of `pipenv install` should always be an environment that matches the lockfile.\nI'm ignoring implementation details, but that's kind of the baseline behavior I expect from a package manager with a lockfile feature.\nRunning `pipenv update` periodically allows you to stay in B mode as long as you want everything to be fresh, and having the ability to `pipenv install --upgrade requests` would allow specific updates of one package and its dependencies, without affecting packages that don't need to be upgraded unnecessarily.\nAm I missing any use cases? I can think of optimizations for B - e.g. a flag or env var that tells it to always update eagerly - but I think that covers the basics.

Instead, it compiles a list of packages that meet the criteria specified in the list of pins from the `Pipfile`. Because the resolver itself runs using the system or outer python / pipenv / pip-tools install, we are doing some supreme fuckery to convince it to resolve packages with the same version of python used in the virtualenv. The assumption would be that `pip install` would resolve things similarly, but that isn't always the case, although even I'm not 100% sure about that. But yes, `pipenv lock` is not generated based on the virtualenv, it is generated based on the `Pipfile`. It is a dependency resolution lockfile, not an environment state pin.",

If the developer does not carefully examine the diff of `Pipfile.lock`, they are still using the older versions locally, but once they share the code, all other environments see the surprising updates. People have a tendency to ignore the diff of `Pipfile.lock` because it's considered an auto-generated file.\nI am strongly convinced that \"update everything to the latest version allowed by `Pipfile`\" should be an explicitly requested operation that is separate from \"install foo\".",

Unfortunately, while the design of pipenv is cleaner with this approach, it's also way less useful for most applications because PEP 518 decided to punt on how to install projects into editable mode so in order to continue using pipenv we will be stuck on setuptools quite a while longer as you cannot use `pyproject.toml` to switch away from setuptools and still use `pipenv install -e .`.",

This is a transfer format that goes in an sdist or wheel and is generated from a setup.py/setup.cfg, it is not a replacement as such for the user-facing metadata. PEP 518's usage of `pyproject.toml` is about supporting alternatives to distutils/setuptools as a build system, no one is trying to replace the sdist/wheel formats right now.

I think the entire controversy boils down to this point really and people (certainly me) are frustrated that we can now define libraries that don't use setuptools but can't develop on them with pipenv. To be perfectly clear this isn't strictly pipenv's fault (PEP 518 decided to punt on editable installs), but its refusal to acknowledge the issue has been frustrating in the discourse as poetry provides an alternative that does handle this issue in a way that's compliant with the `pyproject.toml` format.

Two important parts of python philosophy (`import this`) are 'Explicit is better than implicit' and 'Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.'. I point these out because a bare except is a special, highly implicit case. Every other `except` has an 'argument', indicating the scope of the error to be handles. Even if that's 'everything', it's better to explicitly state that.\n'There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.' also applies, since you can accomplish the same thing for the low-low price of 14 characters. That's simply not enough of a 'savings' to make it worth it.\nThere's also the fact that things like KeyboardInterrupt aren't caught by `Exception` for a reason. Those represent *very* exceptional cases - cases which shouldn't occur in normal (e.g. production) operation unless something has gone very wrong or the user is explicitly requesting an immediate shutdown.\nIn regards to @lordmauve's case: Why do you want to clean up those temporary files in every possible exception case? `except:` tells me that you don't know what exceptions may be raised. In those (hopefully rare) cases, your app will certainly crash (unless you have a bare except that silences every possible exception, but that's a whole new level of bad design), and you will probably need to investigate why. A temporary file is part of the state of the application at the point in time, and therefore will be forensically valuable.\nIf you know for sure that the temporary file will be forensically worthless, then `except Exception:` or `except BaseException:` makes that clear, and indicates that you're fully aware of the implications. If you're more worried about old temporary files accumulating in some way, consider having your app do cleanup as part of initialization. That idea comes from the [Crash-only software](https://lwn.net/Articles/191059/) pattern (It's a lot more reasonable than it sounds, I promise). Basically, it's a lot easier to assume that your app always terminates unexpectedly and code against that than to handle unexpected termination as a special case (i.e. Turning off the power is guaranteed to be an option, but a shut down command may fail or be unavailable).\nAs a last resort, there's always ` # noqa`.

Things like pycodestyle and flake8 are \"production\" applications that should handle `KeyboardInterrupt`. That said, both projects handle it explicitly. I think I understand your point, but it feels like it's imposing a false dichotomy around what is \"production\".\n> Why do you want to clean up those temporary files in every possible exception case?\nI can imagine a few cases where @lordmauve would want to (and should!) clean up the temporary files. Perhaps those temporary files contain some sensitive information and cleaning them up is the secure thing to do. In reality, neither of us know the details and I think we should be assuming that they know their constraints better than us.

The keyword I'm missing is \"include_playbook\" which would allow a \"when\" to apply to it. Why?\nI have a playbook that performs some maintenance, OS, Kernel, package, and firmware upgrades. For Major upgrades, we track progress in a ticketing system. So, during those runs, I'd like to conditionally import a playbook that updates the ticket information. In order for that to work, I need to pass the user's password to the ticketing system, so there's a `vars_prompt` in the ticket update playbook. If the user specifies which ticket they're working to the maintenance playbook, I'd like the ticket update playbook to be called after the maintenance is performed.\nIf there's another way for this to work, I'm open to alternate ideas, but I think conditionally playbook imports would be generically useful. I'm not understanding why tasks could be included dynamically, but a playbook wouldn't be.\n##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE\n<!---\nFor bugs, show exactly how to reproduce the problem, using a minimal test-case.\nFor new features, show how the feature would be used.\n-->\n<!--- Paste example playbooks or commands between quotes below -->\n```yaml\n# Maintenance Play Runs first, then conditionally import a second playbook\n- import_playbook: update-ticket.yaml\nwhen: ticket_id is defined\n```\n<!--- You can also paste gist.github.com links for larger files -->\n##### EXPECTED RESULTS\n<!--- What did you expect to happen when running the steps above? -->\nI expect `update-ticket.yaml` to only import if the `ticket_id` is defined.\n##### ACTUAL RESULTS\n<!--- What actually happened?

Unable to retrieve file contents\nCould not find or access '/path/to/playbooks/ap_hello_world/helloWorld.yml'\n```\nIf I comment out the `import_playbook` play, the functionality above that works nearly like `ansible-galaxy` and \"installs\" the playbooks I need (and the roles they need). ```bash\nPLAY [PLAY | Install other required playbooks] *************************************************************************************************************************************\nTASK [Gathering Facts] *************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nFriday 31 August 2018 13:54:13 -0500 (0:00:00.239) 0:00:00.240 ********* Friday 31 August 2018 13:54:13 -0500 (0:00:00.237) 0:00:00.237 ********* ok: [localhost]\nTASK [INCLUDE_VARS | include variables to discover other needed playbooks] *********************************************************************************************************\nFriday 31 August 2018 13:54:15 -0500 (0:00:01.366) 0:00:01.606 ********* Friday 31 August 2018 13:54:15 -0500 (0:00:01.366) 0:00:01.604 ********* ok: [localhost]\nTASK [GIT | Clone playbooks] *******************************************************************************************************************************************************\nFriday 31 August 2018 13:54:15 -0500 (0:00:00.124) 0:00:01.730 ********* Friday 31 August 2018 13:54:15 -0500 (0:00:00.124) 0:00:01.728 ********* changed: [localhost] => (item={u'src': u'<gir_url>/ap_hello_world', u'version': u'v0.3.0'})\nTASK [SHELL | Install included playbooks roles] ************************************************************************************************************************************\nFriday 31 August 2018 13:54:17 -0500 (0:00:02.591) 0:00:04.322 ********* Friday 31 August 2018 13:54:17 -0500 (0:00:02.591) 0:00:04.319 ********* changed: [localhost] => (item={u'src': u'<git_url>/ap_hello_world', u'version': u'v0.3.0'})\nPLAY RECAP *************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nlocalhost : ok=4 changed=2 unreachable=0 failed=0 ```\nAnd now I can run the same playbook again, this time with the `import_playbook` play not commented and it works as I desire:\n```bash\nPLAY [PLAY | Install other required playbooks] *************************************************************************************************************************************\nTASK [Gathering Facts] *************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nFriday 31 August 2018 14:00:30 -0500 (0:00:00.244) 0:00:00.244 ********* Friday 31 August 2018 14:00:30 -0500 (0:00:00.241) 0:00:00.241 ********* ok: [localhost]\nTASK [INCLUDE_VARS | include variables to discover other needed playbooks] *********************************************************************************************************\nFriday 31 August 2018 14:00:32 -0500 (0:00:01.471) 0:00:01.716 ********* Friday 31 August 2018 14:00:32 -0500 (0:00:01.471) 0:00:01.713 ********* ok: [localhost]\nTASK [GIT | Clone playbooks] *******************************************************************************************************************************************************\nFriday 31 August 2018 14:00:32 -0500 (0:00:00.138) 0:00:01.854 ********* Friday 31 August 2018 14:00:32 -0500 (0:00:00.138) 0:00:01.852 ********* ok: [localhost] => (item={u'src': u'<git_url>/ap_hello_world', u'version': u'v0.3.0'})\nTASK [SHELL | Install included playbooks roles] ************************************************************************************************************************************\nFriday 31 August 2018 14:00:35 -0500 (0:00:02.821) 0:00:04.675 ********* Friday 31 August 2018 14:00:35 -0500 (0:00:02.821) 0:00:04.673 ********* changed: [localhost] => (item={u'src': u'<git_url>/ap_hello_world', u'version': u'v0.3.0'})\nPLAY [PLAY | BEGIN Setup & Timing] *************************************************************************************************************************************************\nTASK [set_fact] ********************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nFriday 31 August 2018 14:00:36 -0500 (0:00:01.323) 0:00:05.999 ********* Friday 31 August 2018 14:00:36 -0500 (0:00:01.323) 0:00:05.997 ********* ok: [localhost]\nTASK [debug] ***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************\nFriday 31 August 2018 14:00:36 -0500 (0:00:00.155) 0:00:06.154 ********* Friday 31 August 2018 14:00:36 -0500 (0:00:00.155) 0:00:06.152 ********* ok: [localhost] => {\n\"msg\": \"Start Time -

Include at least 5 constraints:** **The instruction must be answered using only information from this document and not exceeding the word count limit of exactly five sentences for both questions without any additional context beyond what is provided in the original text, avoid discussions about other psychological theories or studies that are unrelated to Theory of Mind-Sharing.

The document should be written as if it were to serve as part of a brochure or handbook aimed at parents and teachers who are not familiar with psychology but need guidance on how they can foster this skill in children aged 10-12 years old, using the context provided by Dr. Smith's research findings from 'Theory of Mind Development: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Theory of Mind (ToM) and Its Impact'. The guide should be written with a focus on practical strategies for parents or educators that are easy-to-understand, engaging, and actionable. Include at least 10 specific steps based on the document's content but do not use any direct quotes from it; instead, paraphrase them in layman\u2019s terms to ensure clarity while maintaining a tone of empathy towards children with ASD without using technical jargon or complex psychological terminology. The guide should be structured as an FAQ section for parents and teachers on how they can foster Theory of Mind development, incorporating the following constraints:** 1) **The document must not exceed a word count between 500-600 words; it needs to include at least three scholarly references from peer-reviewed articles or studies that support your suggestions. The guide should be written in an engaging and accessible language, avoiding any direct quotes but instead paraphrasing the content into layman's terms without using technical jargon while maintaining accuracy of information; it must not include generalizations about autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or mention specific age groups other than 10-12 years old. The guide should also provide a clear, step-by-step plan for parents and educators to implement these strategies in daily interactions with children on the Spectrum without using any direct quotes from Dr. Smith's work but rather summarizing his findings; it must not include personal opinions or anecdotes about autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a whole, focusing solely on practical advice for parents and educators to apply in their interactions with children diagnosed with ASD without using any direct quotes from the document.  The guide should also incorporate at least two interactive activities that can be done within an educational setting or therapy sessions aimed specifically at enhancing Theory of Mind (ToM) skills, ensuring they are age-appropriate and engaging for children with ASD without using technical terms like 'Theory of Mind' itself.  The guide should also include a brief explanation on how these activities can be adapted to suit different learning styles or abilities within the context of Theory of Mind development in autistic individuals, ensuring that it is accessible yet comprehensive enough for non-specialists without requiring specialized knowledge about ASD and ToM concepts.  The guide should also provide a concise summary at the end with actionable advice on how to measure progress or success using simple observational techniques suitable for parents/teachers, avoiding any mention of specific therapies like PLAY (Pivotal Response Treatment) but focusing instead on general strategies that can be applied in a classroom setting.  The guide should not exceed the word count and must include at least one reference to Dr. Smith's findings from 'Theory of Mind Development: A Comprehensive Guide for Parents & Teachers'. Please provide this information without using direct quotes or paraphrasing, but rather in a way that is understandable by non-specialists and avoiding technical jargon while maintaining the essence.  The document should be written with an empathetic tone to ensure it's accessible for parents/teachers who are not familiar with psychological terms or ASD terminology, but also provide a clear understanding of how these strategies can help in fostering Theory of Mind development and include at least one interactive activity that could potentially aid children on the spectrum. The guide should be structured as follows: 1) A brief introduction to ToM (Theory of Mind), its importance for social interactions, particularly among autistic individuals with ASD; 2) An explanation about how Theory of Mind is typically impa0rved in neurotypical children and those on the spectrum. The document should be written as a comprehensive guide that can serve both parents/teachers who are not familiar with psychological terms, but also for individuals without such knowledge; 3) A detailed description of three specific strategies to enhance ToM skills in autistic kids aged between 10-12 years old. The document should be written as a blog post that is easy to understand and engaging while avoiding the use of technical jargon, with an emphasis on practical advice for parents/teachers without using direct quotes from Dr. Smith's work but rather paraphrasing his findings in layman\u2019an terms; 4) A concise summary at the end that encapsulates all three strategies and their potential impact based on research, with a focus on how these activities can be implemented within an educational setting without using direct quotes from Dr. Smith's work but rather paraphrasing his findings in layman\u2019s terms; 5) A closing paragraph summarizing the importance of Theory of Mind development for children and adolescents diagnosed with ASD, emphasizing its significance to their social interactions within a classroom setting without using any direct quotes from Dr. Smith's work but rather paraphrasing his findings in layman\u2019an terms; 6) A list of three interactive activities that can be done at home or school for parents and educators with step-by-step instructions on how to implement them, ensuring the language is accessible yet informative. The guide should not exceed a word count between **at least {ct+1} more constraints:** 200 words; it must include an engaging opening paragraph that introduces Dr. Smith's findings and their implications for autistic children with ASD, using the document as its backbone without directly quoting or paraphrasing his work but rather summarizing in a way to be understandable by non-specialists; 2) **Constraints:** (1) The guide must not only explain how these activities can enhance ToM skills and empathy, with the first instruction. I need you to provide an analysis of this document as if it's written for parents or educators who are unfamiliar with psychological terms but interested in understanding Theory of Mind development; 2) The guide must be tailored specifically towards a layman audience without using any direct quotes from Dr. Smith, and (b) Include at least one interactive activity that can help children understand the concept through role-playing or storytelling exercises to enhance ToM skills in autistic individuals with ASD; 3) The guide must be written as a dialogue between two characters named Alexa and Dr. Smith, who are discussing how these strategies could potentially improve Theory of Mind development for children on the spectrum without using any technical terms or jargon related to psychology but rather in layman's language; 4) The guide must be written with a tone that is empathetic yet informative and avoid alliteration, incorporating at least two scholarly references from peer-reviewed articles. Include the following constraints: (1) It should not include any direct quotes or paraphrased content directly related to Dr. Smith's work but rather synthesize his findings into layman\u2019s terms; 2) The guide must be written in a way that is accessible for parents and educators without psychological expertise, avoiding technical jargon while maintaining the essence of its importance on social interactions with peers.**Document:** I'm sorry, but your request seems to have been cut off at "

        "message": "@octref Thanks for consolidating already (I was planning to do it this week). These issues were already raised with Marketplace team and here is their explanation\n### Searching by id: `GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github-insiders`\nWe don\u2019t support search on id of the extension(Not supported in SqlFTS too). When we search for GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github-insiders, then we search for two words \u201cGitHub\u201d and \u201cvscode-pull-request-github-inside\u201d. That\u2019s why all the extension\u2019s containing Github are coming at the TOP and results are looking better than SqlFTS.\n**Tip**: You can search by extension id using the phrase `@id:GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github-insiders`. Issue: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/69350. Let's track it there.\n### Searching by publisher id: `dias`\nAzure search provides us custom analyzer to control search relevance. We had done stemming during indexing. So when user searches for \u201cdias\u201d, it returns all the extensions containing \u201cdia\u201d or \u201cdias\u201d both. Here DialogScript is coming at the top, because it contains \u201cdia\u201d , while \u201cdias\u201d is matched in publisher display name of \u201cOpen Folder Context Menus for VS Code\u201d extension. Extension display name prefix match has more weight than publisher display name. That\u2019s why \u201cDialogScript\u201d is coming at the top.\nWe have fixed this issue. We are not doing stemming now. So if you will search for \u201cdias\u201d, it will return the extension\u2019s containing \u201cdias\u201d only.\n**Tip**: You can search by publisher using the phrase `publisher:\"Pine Wu\"`. You can also click on Publisher name in the extension editor. I think this is a good solution for searching by publisher.\n### Vue\nWe do have weights on tags too, but it\u2019s very less (1/100) in compare to extension\u2019s display name. That\u2019s why Vetur extension\u2019s is not coming at the top, when user searches for \u2018Vue\u2019. \u2018Vue\u2019 search term is a special case, where we expect Vetur extension as top result, because it\u2019s a popular extension of \u2018Vue\u2019 language. We were unbale to solve this problem using SqlFTS, but we can solve this using AzureSearch. We can add Synonym Maps property to the index field definition in AzureSearch.\n@kesane-msft Please add any details if missing. After consolidating, one of the improvements we would like to see from you is with respect to `vue` phrase in which case giving weightage to tags might help.",

I don't think there's any definition of \"best result\" where that sort of consistency can be dismissed.\n> This topic shows GLTFLoader design flaws. We don't reinvent the wheel here, so \"renderer.gammaOutput = true\" is not an option now...\nThis isn't reinventing any wheels, and it isn't a design flaw. PBR calculations are done in linear space, with every engine I'm aware of. If you pass sRGB data into the renderer and pretend it's linear, the lighting and blending math will come out wrong. The difference is not huge, and so this not a major concern for many three.js users, but nevertheless it is not as good as it could be. For that reason, your \"good\" result example is not actually correct. But as you've said before, backward-compatibility is important, so I'm not here to advocate for changing any three.js defaults. But because glTF is a new format, and because we're trying to get PBR right, we're going to mark sRGB textures as sRGB, even if other loaders are not doing so.\nSee [this article about Unreal](http://artbyplunkett.com/Unreal/unrealgamma.html) \u2014 > ...textures that are used for color information should have the sRGB flag checked, and textures that are used for masks and numerical calculations in shaders and effects (like Normal maps) should have it unchecked.

I would counter that this is completely possible based on the following arguments:\n1. It's not composer's responsibility to ensure that a developer doesn't try to do something they aren't supposed to do; mind you, it would be fair of composer to issue a stern warning, but ultimately allow a developer to shoot themselves in the foot if that's what they so choose to do.\n1. PHP's namespace aliasing and/or composer's autoloader might be a way to work around loading two classes from different versions of a package -- in other words, manipulate the namespace in the autoloader so that if I install versions `2.0` and `3.0` of `package/xyz` (with a namespace of `Package\\Xyz`) I could reference them in code as either `Package\\Xyz\\2.0\\MyClass or `Package\\Xyz\\3.0\\MyClass`. And if I wanted to import both of them, I could alias the second one to a non-conflicting class name (see point 1 above).\n1. There are use-cases where packages are installed to be run as commands (e.g., phpunit, pdepend, phpcs, phpdoc, phpstan, et al) and would not be included/required directly into a PHP project's code base\nOne use case I've run into is that I want to install `ramsey/jenkins-php`, which inheritantly depends on `nikic/php-parser: ^1.0`, as well as `phpstan/phpstan-symfony` which inheritantly depends on `nikic/php-parser: ^4.0`. Both are commands to be run from a shell, so there would be no actual conflict with each other. The only thing stopping them from both being installed side by side is that composer does not support multiple versions of the same library.\nI understand that this is probably going to be a decisive feature request. I also understand I've probably not thought out every single possible hurdle to making this happen. But I feel like this is an important request to discuss with you and the composer community.\nThank you!",

Hydrogenaud.io has good material on opus if curious.\nWith non-consumer equipment, Opus has a distinct sonic signature, even where the sampling rate change on encode has been avoided. Plain AAC-LC sounds better to me, and I can differentiate AAC at any bit rate compared to lossless even with most consumer equipment, including mobile devices. Do the highest possible quality 44.1->48 kHz conversion to music I'm familiar with, in hardware or software, and I will still be able to identify it. That Opus does this right off the bat makes it a no-go in my book, and I disagree with their reasoning for it.\nABX listening tests are pointless unless they take into account the intimate familiarity many people have with their music; they rarely do. That's a much longer discussion.\nAnyway, use what works for you. Just remember that perceptual coding is generally subjective by nature and not everyone will agree with your likes and dislikes. Especially people that can hear an artifact, identify it, and verify what they're hearing with proper analysis tools, in that order. \ud83d\ude38",

The user name is shown in the text field by default.\n- When changing the user name or an email address name other names are not changed automatically (user name and email address names are independent)\n- Existing sender names are retained (main sender name and user group). All email addresses inherit the configured sender name.\n- Users can still log in with aliases\n### Implementation hints\n- Introduce configuration object per email address (users mail address and email aliases) which holds the name in the first place and later can also have the signature and out of office notification.\n- Run a migration on the client that creates the config object and writes existing email addresses with name to it.\n- Currently, a non-admin user can't see their aliases or change their sender name.

After finding out what the issue really is, it's surprising how little it actually shows up. It is less of an issue with a lot of Julia code in the wild and in tests, and it did reveal a lot of variables which were accidentally global (in both Julia Base's tests according to the original PR, and I noticed this on most of DiffEq's tests). In most cases it seems that the subtly wrong behavior isn't what you get (expecting a change in a loop), but rather expecting to be able to use a variable in a loop is what I've found to be the vast majority of where this shows up in updating test scripts to v1.0. So the good thing is that in most cases the user is presented with an error, and it's not difficult to fix.\nThe bad thing is that it's a little verbose to have to put `global x` inside of the loops, and now your REPL code is also different from the function code. Whether or not it's more intuitive behavior than before is a tough opinion because [there were definitely some edge cases in hard/soft local scoping](http://ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io/IntroToJulia/Html/ScopingExperiment) and so this is clearly easier to explain. But at the same time, while having a much more succinct explanation than the behavior of before, it's now easier to hit the edge cases where understanding scoping rules matters. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I for one would like to see the experiments with `let` blocking. This would keep the \"you didn't really want so many globals\" aspect of it, along with the simplified scoping explanation, while at the same time make REPL code behave like function interiors (which is seemingly what we've always wanted). Or inversely, making people specify variables they want to act as globals\n```julia\nglobal x = 5\nfor i = 1:5\nprintln(x+i)\nend\n```\ncould be a nice way to keep the explicitness, and would make the \"REPL code is slow because of globals\" be much more obvious. The downside is that once again throwing things into a function would not require the `global` markers. But given how this tends to show up, it's not really gamebreaking or a showstopper. I'd classify it as a wart that should get a mention in any workshop but it's not like v1.0 is unusable because of it. I hope that changing this behavior isn't classified as breaking and require v2.0 though.",

In contrast, if you start with Julia as your glorified calculator, when it comes time to do more serious programming you have a much wider array of options available.

In other words just doing `t = 0` at top scope creates a variable that is file-local rather than global. To declare a truly global variable, you'd need to write `global t = 0` which would then be visible throughout the module. Perhaps too weird, but it has occurred to me many times over the years.",

On 0.7, evaluating this (with or without `softscope`) will yield\n```julia\n\u250c Warning: Deprecated syntax `implicit assignment to global variable `first``.\n\u2502 Use `global first` instead.\n\u2514 @ none:0\n\u250c Warning: Deprecated syntax `implicit assignment to global variable `first``.\n\u2502 Use `global first` instead.\n\u2514 @ none:0\n[ERROR: invalid redefinition of constant first\nStacktrace:\n[1] top-level scope at ./REBUG:9 [inlined]\n[2] top-level scope at ./none:0\n[3] eval(::Module, ::Any) at ./boot.jl:319\n[4] top-level scope at none:0\n[5] eval at ./boot.jl:319 [inlined]\n[6] eval(::Expr) at ./client.jl:399\n[7] top-level scope at none:0\n```\nSo 0.7/1.0 are definitely a step forward, and if `softscope` makes certain things easier without breaking important functionality that's great.

        "message": "@slandelle I am sorry but I don't really understand your reasoning, although I understand your concern around protecting the Enterprise value.\nJust to confirm, your strategy is to prefer for us to fork this project so that we can use a logger for a single line of code where you are currently using println, pushing us further away from wanting the Enterprise solution because you are classifying using a logger to output the summary as part of `stats/exports/integrations`, although that information is already being outputted in a different form? To be honest, this entire thread so far makes me far less inclined to introduce a dependency on the enterprise project. I believe gatling is great as a project, I believe you should get paid to support and continue working on it full time, I also believe large companies should pay and help support opensource initiatives. The problem is that I also believe your approach will alienate many people, or at least me and all the people I talk to about this. It's a very simple code change, that actually makes it more consistent, as the majority of of your code base uses loggers (as any developer would expect). You are not even arguing about not outputting that data because it's `stats/enterprise` data. The data is there and available in the logs already! The only difference is the primitive output mechanism. The fact that many modern log shipping frameworks expect json/structured logs means that using println automatically makes you a less attractive product for both enterprise and non enterprise adopters. These println statements just create noise in most modern log shipping frameworks I have worked with as they cannot be interpreted as a single event. This is genuine feedback.\nI would urge you to reconsider the quick decision, because I believe this suggestion exposes no more information than you currently do, moves you towards a more standardized output like the rest of your code base, and would actually show you positively engaging in improving your entire product offering, OSS and Enterprise. The functionality you are planning as part of Enterprise are still attractive to companies like ours, e.g. aggregation of metrics etc, grafana datasources etc. I think you've convinced yourself that any improvements to OSS is a risk to Enterprise.

I was pleased to see that strapi already had support for JSON, so I repurposed the code for `InputJSON` and `InputJSONWithErrors` components to create the GeoJSON content-type. To do so, I've followed the instructions posted on [this issue](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/483#issuecomment-358971985) **Why a separate GeoJSON content-type? (A real world use-case)**\nOur organization primarily works with local governments in Nepal to build official portals that help them connect with their citizens. In doing so, some offices have realized a need to include a feature that allows them to visualize all of capital-projects for the fiscal year. See image below:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24402285/50380691-535ddf00-0697-11e9-9e77-2cad4e1674d7.png)\nWe want government officials to be able to upload geographic information on their own. Due to their limited technical knowledge, we found that the best way to get this done is by providing them with a user-interface to draw out the project.\nI've gone ahead and created a component to facilitate the same. ### Steps taken:\n**Steps to display new input in the content type builder**\n- To display my new field I have added it it in the `/plugins/content-type-builder/admin/src/containers/Form/forms.json`file.\n- I've also populated the corresponding translations in the `/plugins/content-type-builder/admin/src/translations` folder. However, since I don't know language other than English, I've used english everywhere.\n- I added another `switch-case` statement inside `strapi/plugins/strapi-hook-mongoose/lib/utils/index.js` file for my new content-type (geojson), simply copy pasting the one for json. The plugin didn't run until I did that.\n- I have also added images for my new content type in the `AttributeRow` and `AttributeCard` components.\n- I was thus able to display my new attribute in the plugin (this might have an impact on the plugin's component)\n**Using my new type in the content manager**\n- I had to add a few new packages npm packages `(mapbox gl-js, @mapbox/mapbox-gl-js-draw, @mapbox/geojson-extent etc.)` and css files, I did not know how to add CSS files so i directly used the index.html file in the `admin/admin/src/index.html` I know this is not optimal, what are my options?\n- When adding `@mapbox/mapbox-gl-js-draw` I ran into issues as I rebuilt the `content-manager` plugin. So for my present purpose, I have served the CDN through my public directory `/public`, I\u2019m aware this is not the best way to do things. Looking forward to your inputs here too.\n- I also had to update the `containers/saga.js` and update the following line :\n`const cleanedData = (attrType === 'json' || attrType==='geojson') ? record[current] : cleanData(record[current], 'value', 'id');`\n- In the content manager plugin I modified the `Edit` container and its children in order to display my new field type.\n- I created the `InpuGJSON` and `InputGJSONWithErrors` component and served them through the `Edit` component as suggested. ### How it looks\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24402285/50380851-b05c9380-069d-11e9-8525-9452bbb743fa.png)\n### Features:\nThe GeoJSON input component allows a user to:\n- Upload a `.geojson` file.\n- Preview and modify uploaded `.geojson` in the browser.\n- Draw custom points, lines and polygons (multiple points, lines and polygons also allowed) directly through the tool.\n- Search for a place using a search box (using `mapbox-generic-geocoder` with OSM Nominatim), and zoom in to the location.\n### Questions/Comments:\n- What is the right way to use CDNs for JS and CSS in strapi? Im not sure if i followed standard practices for the same.\n- Currently I've used [Maptiler Cloud](https://cloud.maptiler.com/) for hosting my vector tiles. This service allows upto 100000 free views in a month. If needed I can set up a map tile server for the same.\n- All of my changes can be found at [my fork of strapi here](https://github.com/arkoblog/strapi).\n- I'm looking forward to someone from strapi going through my code and pointing out blunders, mistakes so that I can work on the same. I've also submitted a pull request to facilitate the same.",

I look forward to checking out your fork. I'd love to help if I can. Assuming the strapi folks can see the obvious benefits of this, a few areas that I'd love to work on:\n> > 1. Topojson - an extension to GeoJSON that encodes topology rather than discrete geometries, allowing for smaller files and on-the-fly simplification.\n> > 2. GeoJSON model - I haven't checked out the fork yet and I don't know if it is your intent to fully model the GeoJSON spec. It would be great to have the ability for instance to create relations between GeoJSON `Features` and other strapi models.\n@cupofnestor thanks for your appreciation, I'm really glad (first open-source contribution woot woot). I feel both of the features you suggest will ad significant value. TopoJSON will reduce the load, and a GeoJSON model should help facilitate spatial queries which would be awesome.

The emulator should just output the resolution completely unaltered. Altering what is output by the emulator should always be done by the frontend, or through an option that the user has to manually select, but maybe that's just my opinion. The default should just be whatever the emulator spits out before you start doing stuff to it. 2. rotating the game is something that can be easily handled in the frontend without all of the confusion that currently exists 3. 2 is something that can even be done automatically if desired by the user, through the frontend as explained by fr500.\n4. the current method of automatically switching the height/width with vertical games will always result in scaling artifacts no matter what you set the aspect ratio to (unless it's a multiple of both 240 and 320). How can this be considered correct? 5. the current method of automatically switching the height/width of vertical games isn't even making things easier for the user in all cases, because video_allow_rotate = true/false isn't doing the same thing in all cores. The current method is just adding more confusion. My brain is tired. Hopefully the thread I linked to above sheds some additional light on the problem.",

While there is no official statement about this, i also think the core should always report resolution before rotation, i changed this behavior in a commit today. Now that it\u2019s settled i would recommend allowing core rotation again and enabling vertical mode, it\u2019s now upscaling properly for me, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be issues with shaders either. One last thing about fbalpha : if you want proper aspect ratio, use core-provided aspect ratio + DAR in core options for fbalpha (actually i\u2019m thinking about removing this core option and always forcing DAR), aspect ratio is per-game and hardcoded in the emulator for each one.\nSo, yeah. It's not that you're wrong, it's just that you never quite understood what the problem was in the first place. Thankfully, the issue with FBA was recognized and corrected by BarbuDreadMon.",

        "message": "i can explain the reasoning behind TATE mode core option in mame2003:\nthe emulator sends two bits of information to the retroarch API; the games width and height, and how much it should be rotated:\nso, for a typical arcade game, that would be:\n**width:** 320\n**height:** 240\n**rotation:** 0 (none)\nnow, for a typical arcade vertical game (which were rendered sideways, and then the CRT was rotated when put in the cabinet), that information would be be:\n**width:** 240\n**height:** 320\n**rotation:** 1/3 (90/270 degrees)\nthe issue is, retroarch uses the sent height and width regardless of whether it has been rotated or not. so, the emulator has to send the width and height of the game on the presumption that the rotation has happened. so, if you set `video_allow_rotate = false` you will get an unwanted result:\n`video_allow_rotate = true`:\n![centiped-190409-121359](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13054748/55795957-ce20fd80-5ac0-11e9-8bbc-10d01a5cf1e0.png)\n`video_allow_rotate = false`:\n![centiped-190409-120210](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13054748/55795769-71bdde00-5ac0-11e9-868c-f08684fff394.png)\nso in this case, mame2003 is sending the core:\n**width:** 240\n**height:** 320\n**rotation:** 1/3 (90/270 degrees)\nbut `video_allow_rotate = false` is saying \"I don't care about how much the emulator wants to rotate it\", so you are ending up with the game not rotated (fine), but the screen dimension are now wrong.\nTATE mode was added so that it doesn't presume rotation. Ie, it instead would send:\n**width:** 320\n**height:** 240\n**rotation:** 1/3 (90/270 degrees)\n(the rotation is still sent - the presumption is that anyone with a TATE setup would also set `video_allow_rotate = false`)\n![centiped-190409-122201](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13054748/55796687-7daa9f80-5ac2-11e9-9abb-dae5908ac2e9.png)\n(PS, screenshots from behaviour of mame2003 from a year or so ago, and retroarch 1.3.6 - this is what i originally designed TATE mode on - someone else rewrote TATE mode in 2003 so it instead does the rotations within the core itself - personally i think it should all be handled in the front end)\nso hopefully that shows the issue that TATE mode was trying to solve. IMO there's some better solutions:\n1) the API lets the core find out what video_allow_rotate is set to. that way, it can send the appropriate height/width for the situation.\n2) rotation of 1 (90) or 3 (270deg) also flips the height/width. this would be my preference.\ni haven't really thought about the ramifications of these! :)",

We cannot get there with all these separate files in their current form with all sorts of global state all over the place. And as I keep maintaining, the majority of the code outside of retroarch.c and libretro-common should become 80 to 90% tasks, thread-safe and all. Anything global has to go into one centralized place, so that we can make order out of chaos. Not to mention it's more optimal this way as well. The code outside retroarch.c should become a lot more pure, no longer relying so much on global state everywhere, so that we can convert them easier into tasks.

        "message": "We'd all *love* to see PyPI-hosted packages for CadQuery. No one sane is opposed to that. Unfortunately, the core issues here are all on PyPI's side: e.g.,\n* [*Distributing large binary payloads as separate downloads*](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/7852).\n* [*API to get dependencies without full download*](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/474).\nWithout significant movement from the official PyPI community on those issues (which seems unlikely, because there's no consensus as to at what the high-level solutions to those issues even are), it's unclear whether CadQuery can meaningfully do anything here.\n## Explain It To Me Like I'm 28\nOfficial Python packaging standards *basically* prevent sharing large low-level non-Python dependencies like OpenCASCADE (OCCT) and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) as binary Python wheels that can be safely reused by other Python packages. That's bad. Every Python package requiring those sorts of dependencies has to rebundle those dependencies inside *every* binary Python wheel they publish. That's even worse. PyPI has strict filesize requirements, because bandwidth funding is understandably scarce. [The CDN hosting PyPI downloads currently pays **$1.5 million USD** out-of-pocket to host those downloads](https://discuss.python.org/t/what-to-do-about-gpus-and-the-built-distributions-that-support-them), which is probably unsustainable for obvious reasons.\n[The full OpenCASCADE distribution alone consumes **~1.5GB** in space](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html). Now add pywrap + OCP + CadQuery itself + {whatever-else} to that. Since that math fails to add up on my primitive abacus, it rapidly becomes clear that CadQuery won't be publishing binary PyPI wheels anytime soon \u2014 however much everyone wishes it just would.\n## Can't CadQuery Just Do What Do Other Packages Do?\nDifferent Python packages circumvent those constraints in different ways.\nThe CUDA-based CuPy package, for example, [laboriously publishes **one PyPI-hosted binary wheel of CuPy for each supported version of CUDA**](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html#installing-cupy). Why? Because each version of CUDA is so grotesquely big, the only way CuPy can feasibly support all supported versions of CUDA is to isolate each CUDA version to its own version-specific CuPy wheel (e.g., `cupy-cuda112` for CUDA v11.2, `cupy-cuda111` for CUDA v11.1). Of course, that's blatantly insane. It makes the `pip` constraints solver (especially with respect to `pip install --upgrade`) useless, because `pip` thinks those are completely different packages. Moreover, it requires CuPy developers to continually go to the PyPI community with their hat in their hands and politely beg for increases in their filesize allotment. Why? Because CUDA ain't gettin' any smaller, folks. At some point in the all-too near dystopian future, PyPI maintainers will be forced to refuse their polite but gluttonous requests for increased bandwidth \u2014 at which time the CuPy userbase will be quietly required to use `conda` to install CuPy. That probably sounds familiar, doesn't it?\n[Other packages like `nltk` provide a crazy `download()` function that you have to manually call after installing a negligibly small PyPI-hosted `nltk` package shim to *actually* install the package properly](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/7852#issuecomment-812948919). That's probably even worse than CuPY's kludge, because it breaks idempotency <sup>*don't forget to remove that `nltk.download()` call before deploying to production, folks!*</sup>, subverts sane packaging standards, and presumably fails to sanely interoperate with `pip`-based downloads caching. The burden of installation shouldn't be on the end user; it should be on the developer.\nThere's actually a heated discuss that unsurprisingly went nowhere about this exact topic on both [the official Python mailing list](https://discuss.python.org/t/what-to-do-about-gpus-and-the-built-distributions-that-support-them/7125) and [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27205586). Because PyPI maintainers failed to reach a consensus agreement, the only certainty there is that PyPI (and thus `pip`) remains hostile to large binary dependencies (and thus Python packages requiring large binary dependencies).\nThat's us.\n## So What Should CadQuery Just Do What Do Other Packages Do?\n**Absolutely nothing.** The more pertinent question is: \"What should everyone *else* do?\" And the answer to that question is clear: \"Drop `pip` like hot radioactive lead.\"\n`pip` is great for managing pure-Python packages. `pip` is *okay* for managing non-pure-Python packages requiring small binary dependencies. `pip` is fundamentally unsuitable for managing managing non-pure-Python packages requiring large binary dependencies.\nThat's not going to change anytime soon... and that's not CadQuery's fault.

CQ-editor and jupyter-cadquery allow you to use an external editor, CQ-editor can refresh the view when you save a file (that can be outside the editor) jupyter-cadquery as a external viewer that run in your browser and gets updated when you call the show function in your script.\n3. You can build OCP and the others cq dependencies from source but that would be a pain\nPS : Using WSL is actually not very complicated",

Then you'd just need some way for cadquery to find the installed binary libs / blobs, probably via an environment variable or something\nApproach 2 would be the easiest / quickest for a windows install\nApproach 3 would be best if you wanted to use a newer / local version of python\nIn theory it wouldn't be idea as you'd need to manually update the libs whenever cadquery was updated, but it would avoid issues with conda / miniconda installs for those that are non technical.\nAlso it may be possible to set this up via github workflows so that things are auto generated on new version tags.",

We don't want to ship such a fragile thing as our public API.\nKaminari is an abstraction layer for those who don't want to calculate and manipulate complex pagination logic. Or maybe we can call it a DSL.\nWe believe that a library for such purpose should never include something that behaves unpredictably. That is why we're carefully testing our code base against multiple versions of ruby, rails, and multiple kinds of database engines.\nThere are reasons behind APIs. And the reasons are written in the tests (and commit comments / discussions). We maintain tests so that we can make sure we're properly providing what we've designed.\nSo, when you're proposing to change an existing behavior, you will need to reflect your new design in the tests and make them all green for all test matrix.\nThank you for understanding!",

So i install OMV5, i plug in dad's old NTFS drive... and here we go...\nFrankly, i wish Salt guys put the comments inside this source, listing all the bugs related to this module. So any hacker which for whatever reason would change it - would be instantly notifie on old pending bugs.\nSalt seems extremely fragile here, probably no one else except for OMV5 uses it for partitions. Maybe OMV6 could do it outside Salt? Like good old UDEV rules or anything. I mean, before Salt porject might decide to drop this functionality that almost no one use, instead of burden of maintaining it for OMV5 alone....\nWell, ranting aside, i am rather puzzled with your _device: \"/dev/disk/by-label/My\\\\x20Passport\\\\x20Blue\"_\nWhere do you even get this hex substitution from???\nThing is, the whole mounting escaping is one uber-ancient legacy mess. Putting it here so maybe someone would use it. I spent like 3 hours googling around and experimenting with Python that i never used before. Tryied to google some standard about Posix/Linux/bash filename mangling/escaping.... and then Python module to undo it. To no avail.\nOkay, so, to document it down.\n- mtab/fstab and friends is one-of-a-kind ancient mess.\n- it started with ancient BSD (not FreeBSD) function strunvis, which behaviour not documented. Probably that was OS-specific function (a la virtual methods). http://manpages.org/strunvis/3\n- when Linux was mimicking good old BSd it only made ad hoc substitutions for 4 specific chars. There is no any systematic/generic pattern at all.\n```\nstatic inline void mangle(struct seq_file *m, const char *s)\n{\nseq_escape(m, s, \" \\t\\n\\\\\");\n}\n```\nhttps://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/fs/proc_namespace.c#L84\n```\nR(\"\\\\\", '\\\\'),\nR(\"011\", '\\t'),\nR(\"012\", '\\n'),\nR(\"040\", ' '),\nR(\"134\", '\\\\')\n```\nhttps://sources.debian.org/src/sysvinit/2.96-6/src/fstab-decode.c/\nSo, whatever comes from Linux mounts information - should be de-mangled for those four special cases.\nEvery single space-separated column of every single line.\nUgly, and undocumented, but that is what it is. And, frankly, it is not that hard...\nBUT, why do you want to compare with some arbitrary hex-escaped string? what can be a real use-case for that???\nLinux kernel just does not have hex-escaping code for disk mounts.\nNow, to be frank, even this would NOT be enough, because i can have multiple disks with the same partition label. Like many USB thumb drives with \"DATA\" partition. I can even have several partitions with the same name on singe disk!\nAgain, it can be fixed by detecting collisions and adding extra data, like counters or GUID or whatever, but...\nWhat gonna OMV do if OMV's user has two drives with partitions having same labels, and then he hotplugs one disk, or another, or both in any order? Is it race condition now? Is it okay for OMV to have race condition?\nSeems whatever use cases Salt imagined for them here is very different from what OMV users might face.",

And perhaps lack of documentation/understanding/forecasting on Salt part.\n```\ndef mount(\nname, device=False, mkmnt=False, fstype=\"\", opts=\"defaults\", user=None, util=\"mount\"\n):\n.....\nsalt '*' mount.mount /mnt/foo /dev/sdz1 True\n.....\nif device:\ncmd += \"{} {} {} \".format(args, device, name)\nelse:\ncmd += \"{} \".format(name)\n```\nMy inner archeologist says that the `name` AKA mount point AKA target directory is meant to be in bash-mangled format.\nIOW OMV should had created \"\\ \" containing fileneames:\n```\nmount.mounted:\n- name: \"/srv/dev-disk-by-label-My\\ Passport\\ Blue\"\n```\nLinux `man mount` also suggests against the second option due to ambiguity, where the single parameter is mount point name or device file name. I don't know if other UNIX-likes but Linux support those precision keys.\n```\n--source device\nIf only one argument for the mount command is given then the\nargument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source\n(device). This option allows to explicitly define that the\nargument is the mount source.\n--target directory\nIf only one argument for the mount command is given then the\nargument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source\n(device). This option allows to explicitly define that the\nargument is the mount target.\n```\nSo i think that part in `def mount` should better be written as\n```\nif device:\ncmd += \"{} {} {} \".format(args, device, name)\nelse:\nif __grains__[\"kernel\"] == \"Linux\":\ncmd += \"--target \"\ncmd += \"{} \".format(name)\n```",

        "message": "I'm seeing a slightly different trigger of this issue, but with the same root cause and end results. We use puppet to manage some iptables rules on the host[0]. When puppet makes a ruleset change, it triggers the new ruleset to be persisted (on EL, that's via iptables-save to `/etc/sysconfig/iptables`). This saved ruleset includes all the permanent rules we're managing via puppet, but also all the \"transient\" rules installed by nomad/cni plugins. Therefore the next time the ruleset is loaded (e.g. after host reboot), the iptables chains are pre-filled with stale rules from historic tasks. Currently nothing is cleaning those up, and since nomad is appending new rules, the saved rules are higher up in the NAT chains. This is causing particular pain where our ingress containers which listen on static ports 80, 443 get caught in the cached ruleset, because then after a reboot, the NAT rules redirect the traffic to a blackhole instead of the running ingress container. It also affects tasks that don't use static port numbers, but then the pain is deferred to when the port eventually gets reused and is harder to track down.\nThis is on nomad 1.1.5.\n[0] One of the rules we're managing is `-A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP` to drop packets which the conntrack module thinks are not valid, will not apply NAT. The kernel treats these as unsolicited packets, returning a TCP-RST. This tears down the connection between the container and the external service, causing disruption. There seem to be quite a few bug reports about this relating to docker, kubernetes etc, and this rule is the widely accepted workaround.",

Not to be rude but I have stopped all of my app development with Avalonia simply because there is basic functionality that remains broken for years because new features or \"compatibility\" is favored over deprecating or changing things for the better. I like Microsoft, and their acquisition of things usually makes things better, but this workflow I'm describing benefits nobody and it just stalls development for everyone for years.\nMost of my bugs were filed in 2017-2019 and they still remain for the most part. I didn't even make reports for everything because they are so infuriating, or making a reproduction is just so time-consuming, or the issue is SO BASIC (ComboBoxes drive me insane in this) that I'm like \"surely they will find and fix this without my report\" so I just gave up. Whenever I NEED to update my stuff I end up spending the entire day diagnosing things that broke when updating (so the compatibility argument makes literally no sense since shit breaks anyway EVERY update without fail).\nI have janky extension methods and fixes everywhere in every app because again, basic functionality just does not work and I'm waiting for things to get fixed, or events fire in different orders between updates. It's just impossible to justify my day doing this literally every time. I'm glad there is a ContainsExclusive now as I suggested in my PR but it should be used where possible ASAP. Not in 8 months. Then I can remove my extension method that does that in PointerPressed.\nAnd people using my apps understand I have no motivation because of this. They see it's open source and want to help, then attempt to and go \"oh Avalonia with their 1000+ issues\" and try to port my stuff to GTK or something else since they also have issues with Avalonia. Again I don't want to be mean here but this is actual feedback you should consider seriously. You guys do hard work but the workflow is just not there where it matters. It's the hard truth and I wish it weren't since Avalonia can be so great, and should've been great a long time ago. But when ComboBoxes for example STILL don't perform as expected after 5+ years it really does hurt your users.\nI pull every commit locally since I first found Avalonia, even to this day, and I read them all. But I see only new features and macOS low-level window fixes. Nothing that matters to me personally, and I get disappointed every now and then since I see the priorities. Anyway, that's just my rant and my opinion. I hope this new generation of users can develop with less headache than I did.",

Only descending the folder tree would be allowed, so you cannot do something like `\"autoloader-root-dir\": \"../somewhereElse/\"`. The name `autoloader-root-dir` is tentative.\n## Motivation\n### Built applications\nIn modern web development, codebases quite often use multiple languages, some of them compiled (typically something akin to TypeScript compiled to JavaScript). This means that the final application needs to be built. To cleanly separate the source files from the build artifacts, one would want to place all the source files into one directory (e. g. `src`) and have the built app in another one (e. g. `dist`). However, the `composer.json` file would typically be in the root of the repository - that is, *not* in the `src` folder. Under the current behaviour, there is no way to do this, not have the final php files somewhere like `dist/src/` and have a working autoloader. This RFC would enable that by setting `\"autoloader-root-dir\": \"src/\"`.\n### Separating configuration files from the application itself\nWhen an app is deployed, sometimes it is undesirable to deploy configuration files such as `.travis-ci.yml` or similar. With this RFC, one could put the actual application in a dedicated directory (e. g. `app/`), keep all the configuration files (including `composer.json`) in the root of the repo and still have a working autoloader by setting `\"vendor-dir\": \"app/vendor\"` and `\"autoloader-root-dir\": \"app/\"`.\nThis issue is a continuation of the recent debate in #5198. I would be willing to take a try at a PR, if the feature is deemed appropriate for inclusion in composer.",

Preferably this could be done as an extra command line argument or configuration setting. When not specified, the normal limit values can be used as a default.\nThese limits in the engine have no real affect on how the game is actually _played_, so I feel providing an optional way to adjust them would still be true to the _vanilla experience_ and not go against the philosophy of the project. It's akin to how all the networking changes _aren't_ 'true to the original' Doom, or how the Vanilla Save Game Limit or Vanilla Demo Limit are already optional changes you can make. All these changes are to give the _vanilla experience_ a greater range of access, just as they are all equally not 'true' and are not 'pure' to the original.\nTo make the code change as minimal as possible, it could be as simple as specifying numbers for the limits (i.e. visplane array size). One could simply set them to high values in order to run more intensive maps. Another possible and more elegant solution could be letting Chocolate Doom read the map data and set the array limits dynamically at map load time to match what is present.\nI'm sure I'm not the only one who would love to use Chocolate Doom for SiGiL and other maps that are otherwise only incompatible due to these hard coded limits. It's quite annoying juggling multiple ports solely because of this single aspect alone, especially that it doesn't affect the _vanilla experience_ in any way - or at least much less so than the changes already put in and present in Chocolate Doom.",

There are a lot of other folks that we are supporting at the same time as you, and we are responding as fast as we can. Please know that we aren't ignoring you, nor are we happy to close your issues and never respond. Please have patience with us while we try to assist you and others. Thanks :heart: I'm happy to make a temporary fix to support the two parameter method for this third party plugin using an internal library to Vagrant, but as I mentioned yesterday you will likely get more traction and a quicker fix if you open an issue on the plugin side and fix it there. Our Vagrant release cadence isn't too frequent, and there are lots of other issues and features that we're trying to get in for each release.\nIf you wish to get this moving faster, there is already a pull request on the plugin: https://github.com/smerrill/vagrant-gatling-rsync/pull/37 I recommend pinging the maintainer on there.\nFor fixing this today on your side, you should still be able to use the built in rsync synced folder feature, as this is the recommended way to use rsync and Vagrant. Alternatively, downgrading to Vagrant 2.2.5 and using that plugin until a fix has been met is also a possibility. You could also bring in the changes locally and run and install the plugin from source.\nWe can leave this open to track the issue for now in case others find it. If our next release time comes around and it's still not fixed on their side, I'll apply a patch that fixes this so that it works in 2.2.7. Thanks!",

I suggest to add this command only if testing is enabled in my workspace\n2) Sort Imports -> shouldn't this be a part of the format document. I do not see why this command needs to be so promiment to take space in the context menu. Also there is already `Source Action...` command which shows the Sort Imports so this feels like duplication.\n3) \"Run python file in terminal\" and \"Run selection line in python terminal\". I do not understand why one command says \"in terminal\" and the other \"in python terminal\". When I exectute them they just go to the terminal for me. Can we have some consistency in titles, or is it possible to drop one of those actions. Reason being, user can select the whole file and do Run selection, to cover the python file case\n4) Run in Interactive window: I suggest to show this only if I have Jupter or whatever needed setup\n5) Most of these actions do not make sense while you are debugging. I would also consider to hide them while the user is debugging (since the menu grows then additonally with vscode debug commands)\n![Screenshot 2019-12-24 at 12 48 24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1926584/71411983-d66b9980-264b-11ea-822c-a3375166d30c.png)\nI believe VS Code plans to introduce context sub menus and then python could add all the actions to the submenu potentially.\nfyi @qubitron @DonJayamanne",

IndexFormatter works. It simply works, as intended, without any bug.\n2. ``IndexFormatter(x_labels)`` is far simpler than proposed convoluted alternatives like ``FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: dict(zip(range(len(x_labels)), x_labels)).get(x, \"\"))`` to achieve the same exact end result.\n3. The solution doesn't break back compatibility in the middle of minor revision. The users don't have to change their programs. They don't have to find an alternative. 4. It follows the precepts of semantic versioning instead of adopting post hoc rationalisations (like \"others deprecated functionalities in the middle of minor revision so lets pretend it's okay for us to do the same\")\n5. You don't have to spend time and energy changing the documentation. You don't have to teach the users alternative methods that are necessarily harder to implement and explain.\n6. Apparently, the DEPRECATION is based, at least partially, on the false assumption that a decade of zero complaints from the users somehow means the users are unhappy with IndexFormatter and therefore don't use it. 7. THE DEPRECATION misses entirely the point of avoiding the vicious cycle of complexity. Increasing complexity to achieving the same exact functionality is a huge waste of your time. It only make you busier and busier, writing more convoluted code and spending more time managing harder to debug bugs.\nI have wasted enough of my time trying to convince you. So be it.",

Specifically in regards to what falls under repo ownership.\nIt would come to reason to me that landing pull requests would be a \"day-to-day\" task for said project captains, and their particular merging strategies, commit message formats, etc. would serve the repo on a technical front, as outlined in this document.\nI think part of the goal of project captains is to empower them to manage their repos, and commit messages seems to fall directly in that category to me. For example, if a project captain wants to use something like standard-release to automate releases and history file generation, they may need specific structure to commit messages. We should strive to empower the owners to do what they think will improve their workflow.\nBut maybe I'm misunderstanding on that point. Especially if I'm misunderstanding, that definately means we need greater clarity in the document, as we don't want to have everyone interpreting it differently, I presume.

Similarly, the MIME type used to refer to JavaScript in this specification is `text/javascript`, since that is the most commonly used type, despite it being an officially obsoleted type according to RFC 4329. [RFC4329]\n[And](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#scriptingLanguages):\n> Servers should use `text/javascript` for JavaScript resources. Servers should not use other JavaScript MIME types for JavaScript resources, and must not use non-JavaScript MIME types.\nRFC 4329 does not match reality. The HTML Standard does (in this particular case), and https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dispatch-javascript-mjs/ is in the final stages of being standardized so that RFC 4329 is officially deprecated at the IETF/IANA level.\nThere's a bit of a chicken-egg problem in that server software often has a policy of only considering IETF/IANA even when those standards are clearly out of touch with reality, like in this case.

Who thought that F1 is great idea for menu? Why not escape like in usual games/emulators?\nThe only advantage of ra vs standalone emulators is that it support shader and TECHNICALLY it could be better, but on practice its 100mb of shader folder. Whats wrong with syncronization, why snes has sound crackling out of box? U link syncronization with monitors sync rate but it seems like it changes. Why you cant do like previous old emulators did and somehow link emulation with stable generator? Its not very bad if u sync game with time, not display\nWhy sound should lag in 2020?\nWhy you linked sound control with DB and pression +- returns random volume?\nFor example, just scaled image with bilinear filter looks extremely clean like this\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61594968/83236335-5e0c8580-a161-11ea-952e-9696308c42dc.png)\nColor and feelings are not natural\nIts possible to fix with some YIQ, blur, black/white point correction, noise for texturization, it gives this effect\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61594968/83236413-7ed4db00-a161-11ea-9163-7d076ec77254.png)\nMario looks like\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61594968/83236448-88f6d980-a161-11ea-8039-190ef1c86d9c.png)\nNot like extra clear\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61594968/83236780-13d7d400-a162-11ea-9532-d47b1e38261b.png)\nIts also problem that LCD provides unnatural, too juicy color.

I don't know what would happen with GitHub automatic redirects in this case...\nIIUC the concern is only until the migration happens (i.e. until when both `master` and `main` exist and are in sync in nodejs/node), correct? We can plan a time for the migration (similarly to what we do with security releases and CI upgrades), communicate it, and then during that time we restrict push to this repo to those involved in the migration. Once the migration is completed, we restore push to `@nodejs/collaborators`, and ensure the branch protections for `master` only let the bot push to it. I _think_ we can even add a git hook for push to give collaborators a message telling them to use `main` instead of `master` when pushing (not entirely sure).\nAnother idea I have (which I've been thinking for a different repository/organization, is to use the `post-checkout` git hook to communicate every time someone checks out to master (and try to identify if it was ran on our CI etc). That would help us identify when usage of master branch drops enough for us to safely discontinue it.",

I found that @hizzlekizzle was very cool and polite to accept it. Retroarch is an incredible piece of software, powerful but complex to master. To be constructive, I would suggest that maybe all @noiseshaade frustration, and probably many others could be solved with an option to launch a \"first time launch wizard\" that allows less savvy users to get retroarch up and running with a few clicks here and there: Just basically downloading a few cores depending on the system you want to emulate, setting up the gamepad, enable kiosk mode, and you are good to go. With that you cover the bare basics to have it up and running and you can later prettify or tweak the output to your liking. I also found nice the shader preview suggestion (and also a notification of \"resource intensive shader\" would be good). I had some struggles finding out , by example, which was the highest level of XBRz shader my HTPC could handle without getting sluggish. Sometimes it got so slow that I had to kill retroarch because it was faster to relaunch it than waiting to reach the shader menu again.\nNot everyone will agree with me, that's just my two cents.",

They will sing too loud or too quiet (depending on personality type). Any attempt by an outside force (the director) to balance the mix will force them to increase the compensation to detrimental levels.\nThat may or may not be. I think this strongly depends on how the singers can adapt to the mix. For some it may be simple to adapt, for some it may not be possible to sing. But this can only be evaluated on a real test with a lot of singers, I guess.\n> I'd prefer (at least for newer clients) to show \"Please set the audio quality/... as follows: [...]\" or even a server message which sets them automatically.\nSure, a lot things could be done. The current code implements the basic functionality. If it turns out that this mode is useless, all additional effort would be wasted. So the first step is to verify that this mode works with a lot of singers (which are all instructed before entering the server what they have to set in the Jamulus client). If that was successful, more time could be spent to improve that server mode.\n> Is there any way what's done could be tuned to having each participant (apart from the director) see only their own channel control? This wouldn't save server side processing - you'd still have n mixes to create.\nYes, exactly. If you want any individual mix, you have to use the normal mode.\n> I'd also think a \"list participants\" option would be needed. Otherwise I'd be wondering \"who's here?\" all the time.\nThe server could send a Chat message when a new client enters the server. But as I wrote above, before any more time is spent, it has to be verified that this new mode works in a real scenario and turns out to be useful.\n> Of course, my other question is -- how does this affect the jam recorder?\nThe jam recorder is not affected. It works the same as in the normal server mode.\n> I have a little concern with the \u201cfirst to connect\u201d solution for selecting a director only because, supposing it goes wrong and someone accidentally joins before the director, how can it be resolved?\nNo problem.

The Jamulus equivalent would be to send unmixed sound to all users (or to ignore their fader settings), then have individuals adjust their gain + singing volume to compensate, which this addresses.\nThat doesn't solve for the user who says \"I can't hear myself well enough\" or \"The group isn't loud enough\", but that's not a problem that Jamulus can solve. Jamulus' faders are not a control for System Volume - they're a control for \"Jamulus within the bounds of System Volume\". So if System Volume = 50%, then setting a Jamulus fader to 50% is equivalent to setting System Volume = 25%, and setting a Jamulus fader to 100% is equivalent to setting System Volume to 50%.

Currently, we are recovering but the main issue can be brought down to this issue.\nIn fact, I was not able to see the live error logs during testing/debugging the app. So I missed the warning of PHP that a certain set of functions/fields are undefined (typos) and other similar effects. The log was just cluttered with these deprecation warnings (which are good in general). But as these are generated on each invocation (also the update of the logs) this ends in an infinite recursion.\nFor now, I am able to see some useful information by disabling the `files_sharing` app but this is no permanent solution, especially as we are planning to allow for the sharing of recipes in the app. At most that moment in time, we need to allow the sharing again, which will clutter the logs again.\nI tried to create a patch in [this PR](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/24689) but I am not able to get things right, I am missing the knowledge of the internal structure of the NC core.\nI am asking @ChristophWurst to reconsider closing this issue as I can only second the general statement/issue here: *A component uses a deprecated method and that should be replaced by a newer structure.* The fact that it is a core component just makes it hard for other contributors to contribute a \"quick fix\".\nIf this is on the agenda for a near-future update, perfect, just give a short statement and I am going to keep waiting.",

In my case, [install Nextcloud on any computer/server](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/appreciation-for-a-job-well-done/92140) with 0 Linux experience. I'm sorry to see that this isn't the thing here. Nextcloud and FreeRADIUS target very different technical communities. Users of FreeRADIUS are expected to have basic Linux/BSD experience, networking knowledge, and have an idea of how RADIUS and its authentication protocols function. FreeRADIUS is used in installations with millions of subscribers, it's the primary authentication and proxy server for the Eduroam federation, It's shipped with DDWRT, and embedded in many manufacturer's wireless solutions. Organisations should not be having junior dev/devops install and configure FreeRADIUS instances, if those instances are to be used as a basis for a critical service.\nYour main complaints appear to be Debian or Ubuntu messed up the permissions on automatically generated certificates (which is an issue which should have been reported to them, not the FreeRADIUS project), ~and that we haven't resolved a minor dependency issue in our Debian packaging. One which you yourself do not seem willing to submit fixes for.~ This has already been fixed and will in the next official release.\nThe point I was making was seeing that you have a build environment already established, it would take literally a couple of minutes to figure out the correct dependencies. Even if you had zero experience with debian packaging, a recursive grep through the source would have shown where libjson was listed as a dependency. I strongly dislike the sense of entitlement some people exhibit when using Open Source software. This is not paid-for commercial software, its software developed by a community. I have contributed to many projects outside of FreeRADIUS, and I would never come in with the attitude you've shown here if I wanted a positive outcome.",

A lot of issues are feature requests that we tend to be conserative about and not consider.\nThe complexity of Doctrine often makes it very time consuming finding the ultimate problem of the user. We provide free software, not free support.

While I understand that it is frustrating to not be able to use the newer version because you are unable to install the new dependency, the new dependency is not a bug as the addition of the dependency was intentional. To remove the dependency now would be considered an enhancement.\n`libpq` was introduced as a dependency due to RStudio Server requiring it. RStudio Desktop and RStudio Server share much of the same code, and as a result the dependency was introduced on both sides. The dependency is not related to the Connection Pane feature or the ODBC Drivers that it uses. It is non-trivial to remove the dependency and introduces some regression risk. After discussing this with @kfeinauer I propose the following potential solution:\n* Always explicitly link against SQLite libraries (which are used by all versions of the product).\n* Never explicitly link against PostgreSQL libraries - instead use SOCI's feature that allows for dynamic loading of DB libraries through a call to `dlopen`.\nIf we choose to go this route, we will need to ensure that there is a very clear error message if `libpq` cannot be found, and that it occurs very early in start up of RStudio Server.",

This requirement could be removed in a future release.\nTo repeat the points I made on 20211221, RStudio already comes bundled with more than 25 libraries (Qt and icu), most of them completely superfluous. Virtually every linux desktop has those libraries already, but RStudio supplies additional copies of them (I won't condemn that, because bundling versions known to work does add some value at the cost of disk space and memory use). But the one library many desktops do not have installed by default (libpq) gets left out. No offense to you (I doubt you personally made the associated decisions), but I would have have to place this in the top two software engineering idiocies that I have seen over the past five years.\nIf desktop users **have** to have libpq (and I imagine that the vast majority of them would find themselves content with SQLite), then bundle it (or bundle a stub library that allows RStudio to start, but then doesn't allow the choice of PostgreSQL as a database without libpq.

Thanks for opening this feature request.\nThe current behavior is reflecting the long-standing behavior that Terraform does still detect and incorporate remote objects into the state, but then while producing a plan it ignores differences _between the configuration and the state_. The difference reported in your example is a difference between the prior state and the current remote object, and `ignore_changes` has never affected that situation but that fact was less visible before because Terraform just silently updated the state rather than reporting it.\nWhile it might seem immaterial whether Terraform updates the state or not here, it _can_ result in a change in behavior of your configuration if any other expressions in the module refer to that value. To be specific, if you had any reference to `aws_batch_compute_environment.batch_compute.compute_resources[0].desired_vcpus` elsewhere in your module then they would return `2` rather than `0` after detecting this change, and so that is what Terraform is reporting here, in case that ends up being useful context for understanding which actions Terraform proposes (or doesn't propose) in the plan.\nI assume that in your case this doesn't really matter much, because you _don't_ have any references to `aws_batch_compute_environment.batch_compute.compute_resources[0].desired_vcpus` elsewhere in your module and so you don't actually care what's reported in the state. One potential improvement we could consider for this mechanism is for Terraform to try to only report changes to resources that have other expressions referring to them, since changes to a value that nothing refers to can't possibly affect the behavior of the configuration.\nHowever, such a rule is easier to say than to implement because what we've done here is just expose in the UI some long-standing Terraform behavior that was previously invisible, and so changing that behavior at this late state will likely require a lot of research to make sure that the changes don't break use-cases we're not currently aware of. The current output is an honest and correct account of Terraform's behavior, and so I think we need to consider here whether the right thing to do is change Terraform's behavior (which, for something this fundamental, would be challenging to do at this late stage in Terraform's life) or to change the UI to fudge the details a little so that it leaves hidden some details that surface inconvenient truths that don't actually affect configuration behavior.\nWe won't be able to make any significant changes in this regard in the near future, because the scope of this project was just to be more explicit about what Terraform was already doing rather than to change how Terraform behaves, but we'll use this issue to represent the need and consider what we might change in future releases.\nThanks again!",

Until then, indeed if your system routinely makes changes to objects outside of Terraform as part of its regular function then the feature in its current state will not be so useful for you,\nHopefully it can still answer the sorts of questions it is aiming to solve, though: if Terraform proposes making a change that doesn't seem justified by a corresponding change in configuration, you can refer to the note about detected changes to see if any of the changes it detected are the explanation. If the actions Terraform is proposing match what you were expecting anyway, then the changes detected are just some extra information that you can safely ignore.",

The main problem with this change is that we lean on our large team of engineers to inspect their own changes carefully on a per-team basis and apply those changes without constant infra approval. Even when diffs are small, though, we can sometimes misunderstand the plan which can lead to some unfortunate consequences. Not everyone understands the inner workings of terraform, or even the best practices, so there is always going to be mistakes. This isn't terraform's fault, we all need to learn the tool a little bit better.\nNow, though, we have to sift through an entire block of output and tell our team to just ignore it up to a point. Its just going to lead to less clear plan output that people put less effort into reviewing. I think its going to erode trust, too, even though I suspect the opposite is the goal. For instance, take a `google_container_node_pool` resource. If its auto-scaling, every single time you apply the project you get a new `node_count` attribute diff that is wholly un-actionable. If somebody sees that every single time, but I tell them to ignore it because it should absolutely be ignored, whose to say when they get a `-/+` change on that resources (maybe by accident or lack of understanding) they aren't going to assume its also ignorable.\nTBH, I have ignored many attributes in terraform because we may change them outside of terraform and have come to rely on the fact that it really doesn't and shouldn't care about the changes to attributes you don't specify. IDK. Ranting a bit.\nI have to be totally honest I see no point in opting everyone into this for every resource automatically. I don't understand the problem that its solving and unless there is a way for it to be completely filtered out I would love to see this change reverted in the next release.\n(I also don't think the solution is `ignore_attributes`.)",

While the output of this feature doesn't suggest `-auto-approve`, it does imply that `-refresh-only` is always harmless, which is untrue.\nThis is true. It is a hack which has the potential to cause issues. I will update my comment.\nThe only other alternative we can see is getting the team to scroll through and inspect hundreds (soon to be thousands) of lines of expected changes/changes that aren't even changes every single plan run (just for 1 pipeline). A lot of our resources are affected with this issue.\nUpdate: don't us the command above not useable with certain changes: #28939",

Because all we normally care about are the plan changes that will result in create/update/destroy actions on the resources. If the state difference has no impact on the plan, it is almost always noise. If there are detected changes in the plan, Terraform may suggest running `terraform state diff` separately, which may give us some additional diagnostic information if and when needed.",

        "message": "Hi all! Thanks for all the feedback here.\nIt's clear that there are lots of opportunities to improve the signal to noise ratio of the current change detection. As I mentioned right back at the top of this discussion, this is Terraform making explicit some behaviors that were previously implicit and thus a common cause for confusion. However, it's also clear that various particular provider features, along with the historical confusing design of `ignore_changes`, have led to the new behavior being confusing in quite a different way.\nTwo specific things that the Terraform team is researching to improve this feature are:\n* A new feature that does what everyone _thinks_ `ignore_changes` does: declare that a particular resource attribute is not relevant to the current configuration and thus not interesting to track.\nWhat `ignore_changes` _actually_ does is tell Terraform to ignore changes _to the configuration_, which unfortunately means that it explicitly _doesn't_ ignore changes in the remote system (which is the source of record). We can't change the behavior of `ignore_changes` due to [the v1.0 compatibility promises](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/v1-compatibility-promises.html), but we _could_ introduce a new feature that makes a stronger statement, which would include making Terraform consider changes to it to be totally immaterial, and thus not mention them.\n* Heuristics to detect better whether any of the _proposed_ changes (the result of the plan) seem likely to have been caused by one of the _detected_ changes (the result of refreshing), and thus automatically effectively infer by static analysis which changes are relevant to report.\nThis would effectively be an automatic version of the explicit feature I described in the previous point, avoiding the need to explicitly annotate everything and instead saving explicit annotations only for situations that are too complicated for Terraform's static analysis to understand automatically.\nBoth of these features are cross-cutting and therefore not something we can just casually implement without careful design first. However, we are indeed actively investigating both and hope to have improvements to share in a forthcoming release.\nSince this discussion has got quite heated and it seems like we've already gathered sufficient feedback, I'm going to lock this discussion for now in order to reduce the noise for the many folks who are following this issue. We'll unlock it again when either we have more news to share or if we need some specific feedback in order to shape solutions like what I described above.",

With the addition of #30486, we hope to address the concerns raised here, while also taking into account the users who do desire the refresh report in order to help understand the changes within a plan and detect unexpected changes.\nStarting with v1.2, the goal for the refresh report is that _only external changes which may have contributed to changes in the plan will be shown_. This means in most cases, unused attributes changing outside of terraform will not show up in the normal plan output. If there are no changes in the plan, no external changes will be shown in the CLI at all. All refresh information is still stored within the plan, and if a user wants to see all external changes of resources in the CLI, a refresh-only plan can be used.\nFor more details on the change, see #30486.

All businesses are accountable to its customers because without customers, it is simply not a business.\nWhat you don't seem to appreciate is that your project is not a high priority for your customers. They don't love your software like you. Their priority is finding a reliable and trustworthy tool on which to run their business. As soon as they realise there are literally thousands of bugs and issues that are introduced, that when reported are simply ignored, or fixed badly they cannot trust your software, will never use it and will never come back.\nIn my experience, 50% of customers are put off before they even start using your software, and the other 50% find issues that without my help, would cause them to find some other software. Most customers do not fully commit and use a separate accounting system because they cannot fully trust your software to run their business on.\n> Also there may be cases where a BOM could be same for all variants.

I don't want my AI to rip work in progress, that is unhandy. I run these programs on MS-DOS when completed, so the AI rips a complete well functioning product.\nThe PC-DOS disk format is different also it has STACKER, that way you can develop without being ripped by my AI.

(Also IBM PC-DOS has more powerful features)\nI only do Delphi, Assembler ASIC 5.0 (It's almost basic) NASM/TASM and all kinds of DOS Win3.11 and CUSTOM OS Development.\nC\nIs no problem also, but if you're good with assembler and DOS it is just so handy to assemble things ESPECIALLY with Delphi on Win 3.11 you can also put assembler in Delphi code so making a Delphi version of DosBox isn't rocket science.\nI was just planning to make a Delphi DOSBOX for Windows 3.11 and a 512 BIT OS (8 64 bit pipes) better suited to handle BIG-DATA since I have a working prototype of a holo-emitter but it is a very long way from Startrek. First I need a new OS, then I need a new filesystem (any file system above FAT is also my work) But I'm looking into a new way of storing data, but that is more an experiment than a plan so far (Intuitive Cross referencing) I want a holodeck, not a static hologram LOL\nThe 512BIT os will be written in x86 Assembler. Only x86 Assembler writes the powerful stuff. But it will become a graphic OS in no time.\nI have a lot of work to do and I also have to maintain the DARPA.NET AI\nIf you need anything let me know.",

Either way, this is a red herring: the _real_ blocker isn't clippy warnings, it's that I'm getting up-to-speed with the project. Sure, there's a few commits that are sitting in `main` ready-for-release, but there's also a significant number of PRs, some of which are ready for landings and some of which need some polish first. I don't know which is which, so my current priority is to work through them and find out.\nKeep in mind that it isn't specifically clippy warnings that are blocking the release - I raised this work as something that the community could potentially contribute assistance with while I tackle the other blockers.\n> There is no need to review every open PR, fix every warning, or update every dependency to publish a new release.\nTrue, one option that exists here is to push out a release based on what's in `main`, then handle the pending PRs and do a follow-up release afterwards. I'm leaning against this because I don't know the stability state of `main`, and I don't have enough local infrastructure to raise that confidence.

Helix endpoints have a strict requirement for OAuth when trying to use any endpoint as per the API docs: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference. This is inclusive of knowing when a stream is online or not. Hence why you are unable to see if a stream is live (and do/see many other things) if you are not logged in.\n> * A chatterino7 release that supports Windows 7 (my understanding was that 2.1.0 was the last version to support Windows 7, but at some point that appears to've changed, so perhaps this is just a given)\nAs aforementioned, Microsoft has dropped all support for Windows 7. Why would we support Windows 7 if the developer doesn't themselves? It seems absolutely preposterous to me.\n> Is a Windows 7 user still able to have a functioning Chatterino above version 2.1.0?\nSure, it may work. We still don't provide support for it.\n> Also I feel it is dishonest of you to just refuse to acknowledge the quote I cited demonstrating the outright refusal to allow anonymous \"live checks\" even if it were possible for the foreseeable future. There is a difference between \"we could if we would\" and \"we refuse to\". You making a third choice for yourself of \"the choice is out of our hands\" is too late considering I cited a quote on chatterino's stance on this already.\nChatterino is a community-made, open source project. Nobody gets paid to work on it. I'll put it quite simply; Kraken is not being added into Chatterino, just so users are able to see when a streamer is live in anonymous mode.\nYour whole issue revolves around complaining that there's no Windows 7 or Kraken support. Both of which have had all support dropped by their main developers. So I ask you; why would we add support for said feature, if the devs themselves do not support it?\nKind Regards,\nALazyMeme",

I was actually able to install the latest version for Windows normally a few weeks ago, despite my operating system being Windows 7, but I reverted back to 2.1.0 just because the latest chatterino required logging in for \"notify when online\" notifications, as I've established earlier.\nChatterino has professed their unwillingness to allow \"notify when online\" notifications without login:\nhttps://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/issues/2257#issuecomment-739330763\n> No. This idea was already brought up before. Chatterino does not want to start helping ban circumventions.\nSo therein is my difficult to explain feature request. I will try to summarize what I'm asking for:\n- A chatterino7 release that is discrepant from the chatterino2 philosophy of not allowing non-logged in users to receive \"notify when online\" notifications (among other features)\n- A chatterino7 release that supports Windows 7 (my understanding was that 2.1.0 was the last version to support Windows 7, but at some point that appears to've changed, so perhaps this is just a given)\nI guess that's it? I still had trouble formatting this, even if I can tersely communicate what I wanted, at the end of it. If nothing else, will you please spoonfeed me a chatterino7 version of the 2.1.0 installer? The 2.1.0 version on your github is just the source code, which gave me grey hairs trying to work out. For the time being I'm still on the plain chatterino 2.1.0, which doesn't have 7tv emotes.\nedit: removed citing \"protection from global bans\" quote as demonstrating that chatterino used to willingly allow \"notify when online\" notifications without login. I realize now that \"global bans\" likely meant regions in the world, and was independent of their unwillingness to willingly provide this functionality to chatterino users who don't log in.",

In its current form E722 is more dangerous than it is helpful.\nI would like to put it on record that the decision to leave that as-is has tripped me, my colleagues, and many others into writing some serious bugs into our code. Initially I felt pretty embarrassed for not knowing about this for so long, but the more I've talked to both colleagues and friends about this the more I've realised that developers are often not aware of the bug it introduces:\n```pycharm\n# The user hit's control-C during do_something() and it left x in a really bad state\n# This was supposed to be caught by cleanup()\n# So now the user has seriously corrupted data\ntry:\ndo_something(x)\nexcept Exception: # Really this should have been just except:\ncleanup(x)\nraise\n```\nPEP 8 does not ban the use of bare `except:`. That's plainly explicit in PEP 8. It calls out two specific and common use cases where it is permissable. I say \"common\" because logging is not an edge case requirement. And I also say \"common\" because resource cleanup is not an edge case requirement and cannot always be done in a `finally:` block.\n-----\nMost novices and even many intermediate developers I've spoken to will be to swap `except:` for `except Exception:` where their code was already re-raising the exception with a bare `raise`. They do this because they think PyCQA's E722 (via Pycharm or similar) has told them to. When they make this change the warning goes away. But what have they done? - has they fixed a problem? **No** not really. If their code was capturing the exception and suppressing it (not re-raising) then `except Exception:` is almost always too broad. Their code is just as likely to misbehave on a badly formatted date or a function call with too few arguments. It's only fixed one small specific problem of the user hitting ctrl-c. If their code was already re-raising then there was no bug to start with and this has fixed nothing at all.\n- Has it introduced a new bug? **Yes** If they really did intend to catch everything then nudging them away from `except:` onto `except Exception:` simply will not do what they intend. But worse it will look like it does what they intend long enough to get into production many times over.\nThe potential bugs PEP 8 / E722 are concerned with are all to do with _suppressing_ exceptions incorrectly. If PyCQA is incapable of analysing suppression (incapable of seeing the future `raise) this then it's incapable of applying this rule well enough to avoid very many dangerous false positives.\n----\nIn conclusion, I can find nearly no instances where E722 has practically nudged myself or colleagues into writing better code with fewer bugs. I can find many of instances where it has nudged myself or colleagues into writing faulty code.\nI now believe this \"bare except is always bad\" interpretation of PEP 8 is much more harmful than it is ever helpful.",

Is there some other source of documentation I am missing? For example, perhaps some parts [managing packages](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages#managing-packages) document would need to be included in a separate `wp-env` repository to aid in the publication workflow?\n> the package itself gathers a community on its own, pursuing higher goals (e.g. a general-purpose local environment like you mentioned), warranting separate forums, documentation, etc.\nI also agree with this framing. However, having a separate repository doesn't imply different forums or sweeping changes to the documentation, as suggested.\n> The same arguments here about running tests and finding issues could be made for other packages, not just @wordpress/env. And they are not un-solvable tasks.\nI agree the `[Package] Env` label is useful and observe the resourcefulness of Gutenberg's core engineering team. However, is it possible to exclude some of the Gutenberg tests from running on commits to the `wp-env` package? I.e., improve the signal/noise ratio of the CI workflow.\n> A separate repo would require building new workflows\nWhat are some new workflows that would be needed? Relatedly, what are some existing workflows that might require modification?\n> WordPress/gutenberg is the de facto monorepo for all WordPress JavaScript packages (replacing WordPress/packages, if you remember that one). There are indeed benefits to keeping all these things in one place, from contributor onboarding to maintenance to publishing.\nThanks for the clarification about the onboarding, maintenance, and publishing. What would be some maintenance and onboarding costs of maintaining the `wp-env` project in a separate repository? Conversely, what might be some benefits or improvements of having independent projects?\n> Gutenberg repository attract a lot more people and expose them to the @wordpress/env, a separate repository would probably not. It's a great side effect that WordPress (PHP) developers appreciate the work by Gutenberg developers on a local environment\nI'm concerned with relevancy and clarity. For example, when I came to this repository to change the `wp-env` code and documentation, I had difficulty finding the code in the `packages` folder among various other packages. While the Gutenberg project is a remarkable undertaking, most of the code, commit history, CI pipeline, and issues are just not salient to `wp-env` development.\n> I'm also of the opinion that all WP npm packages should just be in this repository.\nIn addition to WP npm and Gutenberg packages, the `packages` folder also includes tests (`e2e-*`) a lot of third-party code (like `react-*`, `jest-*`, `babel-*`, `eslint`, `*-webpack-*`, `redux-*`, `docgen` and `is-shallow-equal`). There are likely pragmatic reasons for keeping development dependencies under revision control instead of `package.json`, but it adds further weight to the codebase and commit-history. Repository \"clutter\" is particularly undesirable when wanting to contribute to a specific environment tool (`wp-env`) that decoupled from both Gutenberg and WordPress core.",

I'm in complete agreement with @WraithKenny and unless someone can actually make a legitimate case like they have for why breaking any of these packages off to their own repos is going to hurt anything I'm done listening to the one-sided enforcement of the maintainers. Improving the monorepo doesn't improve the entire process as @WraithKenny so clearly articulated.",

        "message": "Though I know this conversation has mostly come to a close, I did want to answer a couple of questions that came up. I also still think it's important to consider monorepo solutions to some of the problems which could (in theory) be solved by a separate repository.\n> The test cases that run on this repository seem mainly Gutenberg-related. Which of the tests validate that wp-env is working correctly? Are those tests somehow tied to the Gutenberg code?\nSince Gutenberg is a complex WordPress plugin, it relies heavily on the underlying WordPress environment. If the underlying WordPress environment breaks through a change in `wp-env`, tests in Gutenberg will fail. So you could consider each Gutenberg test also a test of `wp-env`. Gutenberg tests related to file uploads also test that the `wp-env` file system works with file uploads, for example. It's important for us to not make a change to `wp-env` which would cause a plugin to stop working with it. The Gutenberg test suite has the side effect of testing that. We know that `wp-env` works well in CI because it is working great in the Gutenberg CI suite.\nAdditionally, the lint checks will lint wp-env code, and the unit tests will run the wp-env unit tests. So `wp-env` gets a significant amount of test coverage \"by accident,\" just because the wp-env code is used in CI and part of the monorepo!\nI do think there are monorepo solutions to many of the other problems:\n- Build times. Interestingly, `wp-env` doesn't have any build step. If you execute `./packages/env/bin/wp-env`, it will run the local files directly in node, no build step. So I think local development is extremely easy for that reason.\n- Dependencies. Yarn has a thing called focus workspaces, where only dependencies related to the package you want to develop are installed. I think `npm` has, in newer versions, a similar feature, so in theory that will help solve that problem.\n- CI taking a long time. I don't think this is just a wp-env problem! Certainly everyone would love for CI to be blazing fast in Gutenberg :)\nI also wonder if the issue with how quickly contributions are accepted is more related to the number of people maintaining `wp-env`? I don't have the time to focus on wp-env any more, and I often become a bottleneck when no one else is looking at new PRs to wp-env.",

Retroarch NEEDS to up their QA to be able to act as a platform\nfor emulators. This post is meant to be intentionally hyper-critical and nitpicky on first world problems, because the experience is just that annoying. I hope to point out to readers many problems with the readability of Retroarch, and it's common user experience. I also hope if taken seriously, i get a contributor interested enough by my points, to add me and talk to me on discord, so we can work together on bringing retroarch up to a level people expect it to be at, and help retroarch hit console or platform level quality it is so desperately missing.\n==================Chapter 0: I Didn't Even Launch It Yet And I Have Complaints=================\nNote: If you are only contributor level and not developer level, scroll down and skip to chapter 1.\nI'm going to start by looking at retroarchs website and steam page, and boy, before we even launch retroarch\nfor the first time, there a lot to talk about already. Infact, to even do this write up, or rather to attempt to\ntalk about it on the issues section on github i was pointed to, it says this is for bug reports only.\nCurrently, i'm under the assumption i'm already somehow breaking the rules by doing what i was told.\nNot a good start, but not the worst. With that out of the way that i'm posting here on request, and not out\nof ignorance for the warning github gives new posts, lets move on.\nLets look at the Website and steam page front pages. I kind of want to talk about them both at once.\nI'll start with the opening description on both. It's to technical. Retroarch as i see it, is looking to be\na platform, like steam, to access things. Like the playstation XMB, or switch home screen. For a description,\non the site we get \"RetroArch is a frontend for emulators, game engines and media players.\" and on steam \"RetroArch is an open source and cross platform frontend/framework for emulators, game engines, video games, media players and other applications\"\nThis actually tells a user very little about what retro arch is, and isn't. Even people emulator savvy won't\nunderstand the rest of what is being thrown at them. a 'frontend' for emulators? lets google frontend. \"frontend can refer to any hardware that optimizes or protects network traffic.\" People aren't playing these\nonline, or it's not their first thought. They don't need protection from the net when playing mario. Okay,\nmaybe a smart person will think it has multiple definitions, and google more accurately. lets google Frontend Program\n\"A Front End developer (dev) works with designers and Back End devs to create a website\" Well, retroarch\nisn't a website (Well technically it is but you know what i mean), it's a program itself. Already, using the\nterm frontend is to much. If you want retroarch to really succeed, to shine, you need to make it marketable and understandable. The optics matter, if people don't know what it is, they won't know why they should care\nabout being interested in it. when people say it's convoluted, you shouldn't need an 30 minutes of research\nto even understand your opening sentences.\nit also says 'game engines, and media players'. Why? Lets be honest, retroarch runs emulators. Thats what it\ndoes. Why do you need to complicate this? Does it run other things sure, but nobody is seriously wanting it as their number 1 music player or picture taker. why can't you speak english? the steam page says emulators,\nso someone knew that word, why aren't these two sources on the same page for their advertising? Unfortunately\nthe steam page then says game engines, video games, media players, and other apps.\nWhat fucking goon is downloading retroarch just to play music. This is not a good use of advertising space.\nThe human being looking at your steam page can see the music menu in your advertising images. Use your text\nspace better, seriously!!! Why is this so hard! Also, it says emulators, then game engines, then video games.\npick ONE! these are all synonyms in practicality. People also don't need to know it's open source\nin your intro, you can say that later. From what i've later come to understand, the devs want to use the term 'Core'. They want this because they believe in what retroarch does aside from emulators. Sure, except...the opening advertisement doesn't say 'Core'. Here is a good opener. \"RetroArch is a all in one platorm for Emulation that enhances the games you play\nand other Cores. From retro era to modern games, you can even play online with friends!\" This is a fantastic, easy to digest, explanatory, to the point advertisement that tells people what\nretroarch is, what it DOES (Enhances emulator games), and avoid words like \"nintendo\" or \"platstation\" for\ncopywrite while still getting the \"old to current\" idea across. Make your text readable to people! If they want more\nthey can hit up a FAQ. Note: Going forward, i will be referring to a reasonable way to read something, or\na problem with text that is to jargin-driven as \"Readability\" as a unbrella term. This will come up A LOT\nand will be a serious problem with retroarch in nearly every part of anyones experience. Please remember this.\nLets move on. in the websites next section, it says you can run original game discs, but steam says the feature isn't out yet. These are literally giving conflicting information. Seriously? ITS YOUR FRONT PAGE!\nNext, lets look at some visuals here. For the website, i want to look at the \"A polished Interface\" Slide.\nThis makes it look like playstation, cool. Except this isn't what it looks like in retroarch by default.\nMake it clear in advertising this is a skin. Also, ironically, the interface is excessively NOT polished, but\ni will be getting to that as a major complaint in another chapter. But right now, it's a skin, say it's\na skin. The very idea their not saying its not the default skin here, implies someone knew it was terrible and\ntried to hide it. Maybe ask why they needed to hide your real interface? We will get to that later...\nMoving back to steam, lets look at the slides/image roll. First is the trailers. All three are really fucking bad.\nTrailer 1: its a fun logo (sure, fine) then shows the menu with garbage readability that makes a person\nwant to flee just looking at it, followed by showing what has GOT to be one of the WORST POSSIBLE game examples.\nlike, you CANNOT be serious. the website slides show mario, and this trailer has a level ID called zero / megaman129. Show us a actual video game. Make the trailer show like 8+ games of different genres. Make it CLEAR that retroarch plays VIDEO GAMES, and not, whatever the fuck that is. Bad advertising affects\nend user readability to understand what retroarch is and is not. and this is contributing to why you get topics\nsaying people are confused about retroarch.\nTrailer 2: Literally a logo. Why is this here? Remove it.\nTrailer 3: This feels like a meme. Seriously, this is cruel, it hurts. It's like someone took what makes a good intro video and butchered it to the max. No BGM, no person explaining things, no examples\nof games being played, it's super fast (Epilepsy educing even?). So fast you can't even read all the text\nwithout pausing the video. Please make a real trailer. Look at like, any nintendo direct. Do that, but for retroarch. Show off and explain lots. I'll help QA it if you need someone. We can improve this.\nThen the steam slides, their mostly the exact same menu. Why? Why not Show off various parts of retroarch? Actually make people interested. Your telling me you create all of retroarch, and the only part\nyou want people to know about is 2 screens? wtf? Now i can go on, but the pre-retroarch experience is getting comically long at this point.\nI'll move onto actual retroarch, but rest assured, i can REALLY go on about whats wrong before even downloading.\nIn summary\n1: Very poor readability\n2: Poor advertising\n3: Bad use of space\n4: inconsistent between steam and website\n5: Doesn't actually say what retroarch does in words people can understand let alone google. ===============Chapter 1: \"A Polished Interface\"? Actually It's Really Fucking Garbage======================\nNote: I have gotten some responses to points in this chapter from users using custom alternate skins for\nRetroArch that change how the menu actually functions and displays information, and not just the visuals.\nThis chapter is about a first time experience, and as such uses the default skin. Before i actually talk about the REAL first impression, i want to point out i downloaded website and steam\nboth, to check for differences. Guess what? The first impression is diffrent. Inconsistent again? Ugh.\nFrom website, it launched windowed, and you lack the cool cursor, and get the ultra low quality windows\nmenu that feels like a 2005 program with file/command/windows despite that retroarch has it's own in-app menus.\nThis doesn't happen on steam, it launches in fullscreen on first boot. The difference here is very important.\nNot everyone knows you can Alt+Enter programs to fullscreen them. Infact, this is semi-rare info. This is made worst by F11 being the windows default to fullscreen, but boy do i wish complaining ended here.\nIf a non-steam user tries to fullscreen by hitting F11, retroarch hotkeys this to swapping between the windows\nand custom cursor. Now, the custom one looks good, but it locks you into the windows. Surely you can\nmake your cursor not get locked, come on. But even worse, is when someone wants out and presses F11 again. I CANNOT BELIEVE how bad this is. If you are multi-monitor, your cursor is now locked to the monitor\nretroach was in itself, untill you move retroarch. Clickin on it, pressing hotkeys ect won't fix this.\nI don't mean using the retro cursor, i mean normal windows cursor, you can't leave your moniter. what the actual fuck? what a joke! I haven't even talked about retroarch contents directly, and\ni can barely type up this QA review because retroarch literally won't let my cursor go click on notepad. >:(\nit gets worse. If your fullscreen and press F11, your cursor doesn't change, but your mouse still can't\nleave the moniter. The user would have no idea why and think retroarch is just a bad program. How can\nyou have this many errors and i'm not even talking about retroarch itself yet?????\nOKAY, actual retroarch time. You can argue before this, thats a unintended bug, sure. Lets looks at whats NOT a bug.\nSo, we boot into the main menu that is...lacking readability at best. \"Load Core\"? Why? these things are called emulators, call them emulators. \"Load Emulator\" is perfectly reasonable English. It's my understanding the devs want the term\nCores because it also uses something called Cores in addition to emulaitors. Sure, but you want to be\na marketable, understandable program? speak in words people actually understand. it's my understanding the team personally wants 'Load Core / Content' as they want to do more then emulators. In counter to this, i have 2 suggestions. Either split the menu AND load between Emulators (Load Emulaitor / Game), and other Cores (Load Core / Content), or make the load\nbutton hidden untill a emulaitor or core is ready, then have it show Load Game or Load Content based on what Emu/Core\nis loaded! Easy! Also, this menu is bloated.\nSo, 1: Split the cores menu, between \"Cores\", and a new one called \"Emulators\"\n2-1: In addition to Load Content, add a new menu called Load Game right under Emulators.\n2-2: Or, make load content/game hidden until a emulator or core is loaded in already.\n3: Also change Esc defaulting to exiting the program, to a back button. This is semi-common, and straight up default\nin nearly every PC game. If your a platform on a PC for people gaming on a PC, use a PC control scheme. wtf?\nthere is a quit button if needed, and Alt+F4 or Alt+Enter, we don't need to troll PC users with a comically\nbad default control scheme thats normally a menu button on almost every pc video game ever released.\n\"Bloated\" i'm going to define, as to many things being in one menu, or things being in the wrong location.\nHere, we have the main menu showing config, info, and help. But we have a left side bar. whats the difference between config and settings? this is already a readability problem, they can be seen as synonyms. Now, i'm gonna be going all over unfocused here, because there is so many problems their all interwoven.\nThe Config file menu, why is this a menu? 1: Delete the Config menu entry\n2: Move the contents of the config menu, to the top of the settings menu. 3: Why is help a menu with only 1 content? Literally delete this menu.\n4: Move Menu Controls and it's icon to the bottom left of retroarch below the white line. This menu is first of all stupid and should probably be removed entirely, however...\n4-2: Rename Menu Controls to Controller and have this lead directly to the input menu. If you really want,\ninclude the Menu controls in Controller, but really it's common sense, and people can customize this,\nso the stated controls in Menu Controls can literally lie to the user, this is dumb.\n5-1: on first startup, maybe do a first time setup that asks the user what menu icons they would like.\nlet them pick from switch, xbox, playstation, ect. Its also kinda bad to display Switch by default, but\nuse american playstation input scheme, and not having a switches A button actually be A. Readability issues!!!!!\n5-2: If that is a copywrite problem, alternatively let people customize the on-screen symbols with letters. In this way,\npeople can recreate their console of choice setup while working around looking like it clones a competitor, because\nit's a customization option of a user. And don't tell me customization options aren't fair game when your straight up\nstealing the playstation home menu theme >_>\nNow that thats done, we have a nice (enough) looking home. Onward to settings. The entire thing is bloated. There is also a lot of 2-menus required trolls. There are so many times you look in one menu and need to google to find another menu, it's not even funny. 1: First up, just like the white line at the bottom of retroarch, i recommend a new break line in the middle\nof settings. Things below it will be advanced settings, and title the section Advanced. Alternatively, if\nthis won't translate well to alternate skins, instead have a menu in here called Advanced at the bottom of settings.\nRename Saving to Saving Games (Readability, this seems like save Retroarch settings when it's here like this!)\n2: Throw logging, File Browser, On-Screen Display, AI Service, Latency, into Advanced.\n3: Delete the entire power management menu. wtf is this? It's literally empty. LITERALLY, USELESS. WHO????\n4: Rename Network to Online, or Online Multiplayer. (Readability!)\n5: Rename Input to Controllers\n6-1: On the left bar, Rename Import Content to \"Create Playlist\" (Because that is literally what it does)\n6-2: Move the playlists menu into the now named \"Create Playlist\" menu, de-bloat settings, so only people who care about the playlist menus are forced to see and scroll past this option. 6-3: Add a button named \"More Information on Playlists\" or maybe \"Playlists Tutorial\" or similar as well\nto explain what is a 'Playlist', how to set them up, needing cores/emulators, ect.\n6-4: if a Scan to create a playlist in a directory comes up empty, have a pop up explaining why. (Missing cores, ect)\n7: I cannot believe you have a menu called configuration here, when i earlier talked about configuration in\nthe main menu. Why do you have 2 config menus, and a settings menu? HELLO? This is so troll, the\nconfig options in settings/config effect your stuff in main menu/config. Why the fuck are they not together?\nWho designed this? *Phew* now that thats done.....\n7-1: In this submenu, move 'Use Global Core Options File' to the 'Load Core' Menu we are renaming to 'Load Emulator'.\n7-2: We are also renaming this option \"Use Global Emulator Options\".\nReadability is very important! 7-3: Finally, If (hopefully) Main menu config is moving to settings, either delete this Configuration menu, and move its only remaining option (Save Config on Quit) to settings, or move the config stuff from main menu, inside this config sub-menu. 8: AGAIN with the 2 menus needed trolls. Inside Directory we have a lot of playlist stuff, why?\n8-1: In playlist menu (that we are moving to the menu in point 6 we are calling \"Create Playlist\" Menu) create a new menu called Playlist Directories\n8-2: Move everything playlist related from settings/Directory to Music/Playlist Directories. This is to de-bloat menus with unnecessary information overflow, and put settings in menus they are actually\nused in, like any other emulaitor (PCSX2/RPCS3/Citra/Cemu/Yuzu/ect)\n9: Speaking of multiple same named menus, we have achievements, and a users achievements. STOP DOING THIS!!!!\nwhy do you want people to need to google one menu doesn't work without the other menu! THIS IS SO TROLL, STOP IT!\n9-1: Rename User to Account Settings & Achievements\n9-2: Move the achievements menu into this newly named menu to de-bloat settings, and put this in a reasonable spot.\n9-3: The Accessibility menu only has 1 option in it. Stop having troll 1 option menus. Delete this menu\n9-4: Rename the Sub-menu \"Accessibility Enable\" To \"Text to Speech\"\n9-5: Move \"Text to Speech\" to the Account Settings & Achievements, so one user can use it, and\nanother different user doesn't have to deal with troll text to speech in their ears. 10: Continuing from 9, we have streaming options in account, and them in recording. WHY.\n10-1: Rename \"Recording\" to \"Recording & Live Streams\"\n10-2: move the the content of the now \"Account Settings & Achievements\" / Account / Retroachievements to\nthe Achievements menu that was moved here in part 9. 10-3: The Youtube/Twitch/Facebook Gaming sub-menus only have 1 content, STOOOP FUCKINGGG DOOOING THIIIIS. >:((((\nwe are deleteing these sub-menus. 10-3: Move the menus inside the Youtube/Twitch/Facebook Gaming sub-menu stream key options from here, to the now named \"Recording & Live Streams\" menu. 10-4: in the \"Recording & Live Streams\" menu/Streaming Quality, give one of those grey sub-descriptions.\nSomething like \"Suitable for 720P Streams\" \"For 1080P Streams\" Ect. 10-5: Also rename the menu to Stream Quality.\nOh boy, onto input (that we said we are renaming to Controller)\n11-1: Move Maximum Users to...somewhere. Wtf even is this menu? If this actually means users, move it to the\nrelevant online menu. If it means locally, rename this to \"Maximum Controllers\". 11-2: If the later, Create one of those Advanced Options line breaks again at the bottom, and move this\ndown there, along with every other option in this menu untill we get to Menu Controls. 11-3: MENU CONTROLLS? HELLO? Why does main menu get help on menu controlls, BUT WE HAVE A ACTUAL MENU CONTROLS MENU? PUT RELEVANT MENUS IN RELEVANT PLACES THANK YOU.\n11-4: Move the Automatic Mouse Grab option to the Video menu in Settings. This is something usually in that\nmenu on other programs, stop being unintuitive!!! How can you make so many mistakes!!!\nSpeaking of the Video menu, lets tackle that next.\n12-1:in Fullscreen Mode, rename Windowed Fullscreen to \"Borderless Fullscreen\" or just \"Borderless\",\nand change the description appropriately.\n12-2: Rename Fullscreen Width & Height to \"Custom Width\" (& Height). It's already in the fullscreen sub-menu, you don't need to remind them what menu they are in, it's at the top of the screen!\n12-3: Move CRTSwitchRes and Output below the Fullscreen and Windowed sub-menus. Order matters! Most important\nthings go on top!\nI can keep going, but i'll stop here. This is a Serious Checklist of Readability improvements across the entire settings menu. However, if i reconsider, i may suggest adding Controller to the left bar as a major\nmenu instead, as it's reasonab;y so important, it should be a major menu, rather then some garbage like Music.\n=====================Chater 2: A Smoothe Gameplay Experience? Or A Troubleshooting Nightmare?=====================\nBefore i get into further details on games, i strongly recommend a new setting somewhere, on by default, that\nmakes it so when you load a game, and pick a emulaitor (Remember, we are calling these Games and Emulaitors, NOT\nCores and Content) that it associates that game to that emulaitor by default. In the future, you should be\nable to Load game -> Pick the game -> it just boots up without needing to pick a emulaitor. I...HOPE i don't have to explain how bad it is that steam retroarch is missing a download button. I will skip\nover the easy wall of text on this and move forward.\n1: For steam users, there should still be a download emulaitor button, but as a submenu. 1-1: In here, There should be a link to your website with a list of emulaitors to download.\n1-2: There should be a setting here, or in the Install Emulaitor menus to set the directory for cores.\nThis is because this options is only useful & relevant right at this moment, and never again, so it\ndoes not need to be in the directroies menu elsewhere.\n2: When in-game, move the Command/Menu button to the top of the list. I also feel a menu rename is in order, but can't think of one right now, and want to move on.\n3-1: Add save state and load state to the Command menu. Yes i know they are in the F1 menu. Make them accessable.\n3-2: In the F1 menu, move State slot below load state\nAnd oh boy, lets get into the F1 menu. In no particular order...\n4-0: Make it WAY more obvious to assign a button or combo to open this menu from controller.\nprobably include it in the quick menu directly at the bottom, even if the option exists somewhere else,\njust duplicate it. 4-00: Also, Escape should open the quick menu by default\n4-1: Originally i said Rename Information to Game Information, but i forgot i was still allowing for cores/content menus before.\ni now suggest making this menus name be contextual, based on if a emulator, or core is loaded. This way people only using\nemulators can have it reasonably say 'Game Information' and those who use cores still get 'Information' so it\ndoesn't clash with any development team desires.\n4-2: Move the Controller menu to right below Close Content\n4-3: Also rename that to Close Game\n4-4: Adding something to favorites and you can't remove it? WHY? Make this menu change to Remove from Favorites if it's a favorite >_>\n4-5: Remove the descriptions for Resume, Restart, and Close game. This screen has lots the player wants\nto see and not enough screen space even when in fullscreen. 4-6: Also remove descriptions on save state, load state, Take Screenshot, Cheats, Achievements, and Rewind.\n4-7: (Someone gave a good point against this, nevermind)\n4-8: Make it so if the player presses cancel in the F1 to go to Main Menu, Then cancel again, it resumes the game.\n4-9: move Show Desktop Menu from Main Menu while ingame to somewhere else (Probably settings).\nWith that out of the way, once ingame, there is no menu option to go back!\nAdd a button in windowed mode to open back the retroarch menu. If you tell me it's a hotkey, i don't care.\nthats not intuitive! Make a button to go back to the retroarch menu!!!\nFinally, this SHOULD be obvious, but it's not, so i will say it here.\nI assume this is a major feature, but really, let people access that emulaitors settings when using it.\nif we can't do that, retroarch is just worse then every emulaitor, because they have settings you NEED to even\nrun some games. If this option DOES exist, it's EXTREMELY hidden!\nMoving on, post gameplay, your recent games don't show up in load content / load game.\nWhy isn't there a recent games list? And why can't you set a content / game directory in directories? If you can, that option should 100% be in the load content / Load Game menu, as this is where\nit's actually relevant!!!\n=======================Ending==================\nI'll stop here, it's been 3 hours of complaints, but retroarch is riddles with terrible quality.\nWhy would anyone want to use this? 1: An unfun troubleshooting experience in exchange for playing games in the worst quality possible without access to emulators settings. 2: Some games are literally unplayable in retroarch because you can't access emu settings\n3: The menus are bloated, and lie / decieves / give half truths by hiding relevant other options in other menus\nfor no other reason then to troll you. The overall feeling is Retroarch is giving you the run-around, asking you\nto do something in some menu you don't know where it is, and when you find it, wants another setting in\nanother menu you don't know where it is. 4: it's a pain to setup even for simple emulators\n5: you can't even understand what retroarch is or isn't from inconsistent and contradictory messages,\nto near moon-rune levels of advertising.\n6: unintuitive menus and lacking default settings mean you need to go over everything before even attempting\nto test a single title.\n7: Using it via steam is a whole extra nightmare that could be made easy if anyone actually fucking cared.\nIt's easy to see why people don't recommend recroarch. The real question is if anyone is going to actually\ndo anything about it, or delete this post / no reply / no one for me to directly work with in a timely fashon /\nstick their head in the clouds and ignore why people don't enjoy their product. My discord is Dawnbomb#3408, and i'm open to any actual developer contacting me and working hand in hand for\nsome actual quality assurance before the steam deck launches, but considering how obvious, easy, and\nnear intensionally-troll the levels of design are here, i expect no contact and noone willing to work to make\nretroarch not be complete fucking bullshit bloatware on a PC, and i only scratched the surface of this QA nightmare.\n====================Chapter 3: Extra add-ons i thought of later=========================\nNote: Some of the things here delve closer to more serious changes to retroarchs codeing.\nStill, their good changes.\n1: Controller backround input should be in the input (Hopefully named Controller) Menu, not in another menu (User Interface).\nSetting up controller input in your controllers, then having if the actual input happens be decided in a separate menu, is another weird location problem.\n2: While im at it, Turbo Fire should be a setting INSIDE a controllers port controls. This would allow each controller to have separate turbo settings per player. 3: Altho highly unusual, some players enjoy playing games with two people one controller mode. Some people even go so far as to speedrun like this. Allowing multiple controllers assign buttons to the same button on the same port of a input would go a long way in support for those people.",

Since this project is not using any features from pytest, it makes no sense for us to go out of our way, even if it is only slightly out of the way, to accommodate pytest.\nAdding correctly working pytest support is VERY important.\nThat importance is not only about exact tested module. Just please add to testing picture fact that in exact test suite is adding yet another workload to all modules involved in testing. In other words it is about health of whole ecosystem (in this case python ecosystem).\nAdditionally .. I 'm finishing now some packages build automation to be able to run kind of set f scratch build if build systems are not bus. In case of python it address some random set of additional pytest extension and perform build with logging results .. only. In such cases if for example if lets say will be added `pytest-randomly` it would be possible to prove that random reshuffling units may cause that test suite fail it will mean that internally test suite have some dependencies between units and even if all test suite executed without `randomly` extension running exact unit by `pytest <some/file.py>::<some_unit>` will definitely fail. Sometimes test suites are running quite long time or on implementing new unit such way of running isolated units may be useful.\nI want only to say that as long that `markdown` test suite will be not working I would not be able to do that or in this exact case I would be doing that only with part of the test suite.\nForm that point of view I'm asking to to fix test suite or something like that.\nAs I have now `markdown` in set of my distro packages I'll be to perform such new way of testing your module.\nIn other words I want only to encourage to prepare some base line id you want to have such testing completely for free (that automation will be only flagging some found issue without single second spend by you :) )\nIf you don't care about that is 100%/perfectly fine :)\nIf you care .. just please have look closer on the code which you know because cost of that fix may be really low :)\nI'm specialist on packaging area so form me fixing that seems is a bit to high :P (I've stumped on python modules only ~10 months ago so I'm still learning however after finishing +700 modules as rpm/Solaris IPS packages I see some patters which I can exploit giving back to the community results of my work).\nCheers :)",

Cornering other projects into using one specific testing framework is not a good idea, and it takes away the freedom of that project to maintain their project in a way that they find most suitable to them.\nWhat if some other framework comes out that a project finds more enticing than pytest? Are they not allowed to take advantage of that testing framework as to not break your pytest dependent system?\nI'm not seeing an advantage for us to switch to pytest, and I definitely can't see a reason to set up and test an additional framework that will test the exact same tests.\nAgain, I have nothing against pytest, and I do use it myself. There are features pytest has that make testing easier in some cases, but this project doesn't currently have a scenario that we **need** anything beyond what is already offered by Python's unittest module.",

What could be done next with those results is matter of running that framework on larger scale to be able identify some patterns and maybe design some other automation on top of that.\nGoing back to the ticket subject.

Bypassing the screenshot portal is unacceptable, as it defeats the point of having the portal in the first place. Applications should not be able to screenshot your desktop without your permission.

        "message": "For people who are a bit newer to Linux - Note that Ubuntu releases are the year and date, so Ubuntu 22.04 was released 2022 on the 4th month.\nUbuntu 22.04 LTS comes with GNOME 42.5 (you can verify this yourself by running `gnome-shell --version`), and it's extremely unlikely to receive an official update to GNOME 43. LTS releases happen every two years, so the next one will be Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, which will include GNOME 43 or a newer version. So right now, for Ubuntu LTS you can expect this to be fixed in about a year from this posting, in 2024 on the 4th month.\nIf you want GNOME 43 sooner, you can upgrade to Ubuntu 22.10 now or newer versions when they're released. None of these will be considered LTS releases though and non-LTS releases have a shorter support period of 9 months. This means you'll need to upgrade more frequently to stay on a supported version.\nAnother option is to install GNOME 43 from a third-party repository (like a PPA) or build it from source. This method can be risky, as it might cause compatibility issues or system instability. If you choose to try to do this, you should really consider backing up your data and be ready to troubleshoot potential issues. Although, if you had to read this to understand the situation, I don't really suggest this option.",

Along with that you have categorical dependent variable.

Those mindsets aren't even usually the mindset of the developer using your library, they're probably dictated by the organisation they work for and having a conversation to change those standards is either way above their pay grade or a battle that's not worth fighting. The problem here isn't one of who is right or wrong, it's one of practicality. The removal of the interfaces causes the amount of work some consumers have to do to significantly increase. Most devs really just need to deliver the work they had promised within the timeframe promised. I'm a huge fan of MockHttp but in my case, updating over 1000 tests to use it (which were written 5 years ago) is a huge amount of work. No matter how you plan your pipeline, the sizing of the work item is now completely invalid. The amount of work required to update your library has become inhibitive to doing so - it will either have to be picked up as a separate work item or it just won't ever get updated.\nIrrespective of whether consumers are testing the right thing, using IoC correctly or just plain writing crap code, they no longer have the flexibility to choose like they used to. I think most devs would agree that the code changes make sense but at the end of the day we all need to deliver functionality to a business and I guarantee that those business users really don't care how well the code is written as long as it reliably does what they need. The best development tools out there make our lives easier. That's why we use them - they abstract us away from the detail/hard work we really don't need to care about and they provide flexibility to customise how we utilise them. They help us do more, faster. Removing these interfaces does the opposite of that, irrespective of whether it's \"better\" code or not.",

But it's also low level enough that I usually don't bother ;). Usually we mock at the level above that, which is our REST API client contract. After all the point of mocking is to be able to stub out lower level stuff as a black box and assume that black box works correctly. That assumption works as then you expect something else to validate that the actual client itself is properly tested (integration test etc).\nAnd there is a good argument to be had that writing tests to ensure the client itself is actually working correctly is much better being done by mocking HttpClient as suggested. Something that was almost impossible to do with earlier versions of RestSharp, but is now much easier to do now it relies on HttpClient internally so you can swap it out for mocking purposes.",

However, you might still want to check if your API client forms requests in a certain way. I have to disagree with this. I don't think calling actual services from unit tests is good practice. At that point they're functional tests. next line goes into that;\n> As RestSharp uses HttpClient internally, it certainly uses HttpMessageHandler. Features like delegating handlers allow you to intersect the request pipeline, inspect the request, and substitute the response. You can do it yourself, or use a library like [MockHttp](https://github.com/richardszalay/mockhttp)\nthis requires me to actually know how you're making your calls inside your library that you publish to nuget. The main reason people wants to use external libraries is to not be concerned about the internals of that external code. It also assumes I know to use this MockHttp library (had no idea it existed, I didnt need to since I've used RestSharp to handle all \"HttpClient\" related things so far), with the assumption that, that package will also be maintained properly and will not be making breaking changes.\n> Mocking an infrastructure component like RestSharp (or HttpClient) is not the best idea.\nThis statement is also wrong in my opinion. I think the opposite actually, making us test external library code in our _unit_ tests implicitly makes them not unit tests, because we are always testing more than a small \"unit\" of code, in addition to our code change, now we're testing your code.\n> As RestSharp uses HttpClient internally\nWhat happens when you decide to not use HttpClient, but use \"MyGrandmasHttpClient\". Do we then have to refactor all of our code bases with the \"MockMyGrandmasHttpClient\" package?\nI am fine with removing every other interface on this package. Except for that single one.\nThis wouldn't be an issue if we were able to mock classes like Java allows, however removing this 1 single interface with 1 single method causes design issues, as well as wasted hours for millions of developers. I would also be skeptical about the suggested \"if you don't like 107, just remain on 106\" By it's nature, RestSharp deals with connectivity, that increases the chances of 0 day vulnerabilities or other security issues. We won't be able remain on 106 forever, and would be forced off of this package. Which would be a shame because we love RestSharp.\nI really appreciate your work on maintaining this package, there is a reason it's one of the most popular packages on .NET.

        "message": "> What happens when you decide to not use HttpClient, but use \"MyGrandmasHttpClient\". Do we then have to refactor all of our code bases with the \"MockMyGrandmasHttpClient\" package?\nThat's an exaggeration. RestSharp uses elements of .NET under the hood, and for many years it was `WebRequest`. Then, Microsoft decided to scrap it and re-implemented it using `HttpClient`, causing massive problems. Essentially, RestSharp uses the only way available in core .NET to make HTTP calls, and it's `HttpClient` until Microsoft decides to do something else. All other .NET libs for making HTTP calls like Refit or Flur also use `HttpClient`, and most people use `HttpClient` directly. So, when _that_ changes, all the code for .NET will need to change, which is very unlikely.\n> This statement is also wrong in my opinion.\nThe issue here is that by creating an interface mock you will assert if the client is formed according to your idea of how it should be formed. However, it doesn't guarantee that the actual HTTP request will be valid. That's why `HttpClient` has no interface and cannot be mocked. And that's why people normally use a test version of `HttpMessageHandler` instead, as `HttpClient` itself is just forming a message, but the actual _oevr the wire_ implementation is in the handler. See this [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36425008/mocking-httpclient-in-unit-tests).\n> I have to disagree with this. I don't think calling actual services from unit tests is good practice.\nYou don't have to call the actual service, you can call a simulation. That's what many RestSharp tests do for making sure that the server can understand the request in the way it should.\nAgain, I am not against bringing the interface back, but it won't be the original interface. Essentially, there are just a handful of core functions of the client itself (`ExecuteAsync` is the main one), all the others are just extensions.\nI actually think that the interface would help for building something like a retryable client with Polly, as it could be done in a wrapper using composition.",

I tried a few time to say I was considering making it default and only got positive feedback. So I did it, with extensive alpha, beta, and RC time to complain and ask for modifications.\nSo here is my challenge, if I don't make it the default, no-one know about it. It's astonishing that no-one found the bug @ehamiter described above in 2 years ! That alone would have definitely delayed the release, and at least I would have had tried to fix it.\nI've also seen a number of new users misformating Python code and taking really bad habits in the Repl, including folks that did not even realise IPython terminal was multiline. For many of those users black by default is much better. You get use to proper code formatting. So you learn to properly _read_ python code.\nAnd it is much easier to deactivate something you don't like than even figure out it something that may exists. For many users this benefits to, having this option be opt-in would make black auto formatting be part of the [unknown unknowns].(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns). So I will _never_ get feedback from these. This is in the same vein as \"but you can configure vim to do so\". > 2. make it much easier to opt out;\nIt's really hard to make it much easier, there have been a long standing issue to have persistent config, but that's far beyond the time and funds we have for that in IPython.

But I much prefer a reaction like:\nhttps://twitter.com/jnuneziglesias/status/1478867554009452545\n> Black formatting by default is \ud83e\udd22 though \ud83d\ude1c \u2014 made myself a todo to turn it off. \ud83d\ude02 Can yapf be configured in its place?\nWhich I'm more likely to help with (and did in a thread). Than spitting on maintainers, which is painful and counter productive.\nI'll try to restore some of my mental sanity.

Since enabling `black` auto-formatting, I have found my own data processing to be 200% more legible (and has made typos, bugs and flaws 500% more obvious).\nBeyond the toll on tech debt and throughput, needing to worry about the \"proper\" way to format code has a real psychological toll. An analyst once handed off a notebook containing a few hundred lines of code. They apologized for the \"how bad\" their code was. Literally all I had to do was run, `black-nb`, and suddenly I was staring at some of the most careful, clever and well-constructed python I'd ever seen, albeit with a ton of copy-paste (DRY would arguably have been an antipattern for this use case).\nSimilarly, I set up all of our team repos--including where we store our \"lab notebooks\"--to run black (and isort) via pre-commit. I expected the junior team members to struggle with that. Instead, the feedback I received was gratitude that they didn't really have to learn or worry about all the various PEP8 rules; and relief that they didn't have to apply a dozen formatting rules during PRs.\nIn these ways, `black`-by-default leads not only to an essentially free jump in code quality and an easy ramp for new python programmers to get comfortable with the language's code conventions, but a demonstrable _empowerment_ of coders of all skill and experience levels to feel confident that their code is worthy of sharing without feeling self-conscious just because they don't always know the best place to put line breaks.\nThank you, IPython team, for doing this. This is a huge step for software integrity and for making python more accessible to the vast majority of programmers and python users who will benefit from having linted code out of the box. Let the experts who \"know what they're doing\" and want the software to \"get out of their way\" build their own customizations and workarounds.",

I see the solutions where many others see unmanagable complexity.\nNo other participant has done the necessary research to prepare this standard. I have spent about 2 months researching and implementing this feature in all 3 main browsers. With that knowledge, as a seasoned software architect, I have much deeper understanding of the implementation details and risks. As a comparison, I estimate other participants spent a few hours (few comments), Scott a few days (specification + examples).\nI have found that the claims of the other participants (Domenic and Scott) are technically wrong assumptions that have no evidence. They did not provide evidence for their claims when [asked to do so]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-964879335 ). The request was simply ignored.\nI have documented the research and evidence in 15+ page-length comments and a [proposal]( https://kaleidea.github.io/whatwg-search-proposal ).

suspect it is the same on WireGuard, but I have not tried that as I do not have access to a WireGuard VPN as of now) on a qBitTorrent app hostPath mounts are not mounted properly (also tried PVC, that didn't work either). The connection works (the logs show the VPN IP, not my IP), and adding and downloading torrents works, it just doesn't download them to my torrent dataset, making them inaccessible. This exact same configuration with VPN disabled works as intended, just without the VPN.\n**To Reproduce**\n<!--\n- make sure that if you follow these steps again yourself the bug happens again. if it doesnt its probbly a configuration error and should be handled with a support thread on the discord\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Go to '...'\n2. Click on '....'\n3. Scroll down to '....'\n4. See error\n-->\n1. Create a qBitTorrent app\n2. Configure a hostPath/PVC mount\n3. Configure a valid OpenVPN connection\n4. Configure the app so it should function (proper ports, etc.)\n5. Start this app\n6. To observe: open shell for the qBitTorrent container (not the OpenVPN container, although nothing appears there either). The hostPath/PVC mount will not be mounted.\n**Expected behavior**\n<!--\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\n-->\nThe configured mount should be there.\n**Screenshots**\n<!--\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\n-->\n**Additional context**\n<!--\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\n-->",

This implies that only a single instance of an extension can run inside a window. Some settings require to reload the window after change typically because they are used in constructors (theirs values are fixed in the instance). All these settings must not have the `resource` scope. This is probably why the default scope is `window`.\nHence, making the list of settings that could have the `resource` scope is not so simple.

Yes, **REDIRECTS** exist for exactly this purpose. For an important infrastructure project it is expected that documentation writers understand these concepts. The underlying issue here is not just a simple 404 - it seems like the documentation writing person is not informed about the existence of redirects and believes that it is OK to just remove URLs from the internet - this should be made clear on day one for anybody doing this kind of work: it is NOT!\nAlso we see here a complete lack of understanding and empathy for the readers situation, what is another very important skill for documentation writers that must be required for such a job position. The person who introduced this problem did not think for one second about how annoying and disctracting it is to find a broken URL while the reader is trying to figure out some technical details. This all can be fixed on a technical level with simple redirects - but it needs to be fixed on a human level, the person who did this needs to learn about the importance of respecting the reading experience, this is of course true for the project manager.

The slowness of gl4es must be because the graphics are forced, since mesa does not provide a correct rendering, I think that explains why gl4es is slow I was guided by this page : https://gxmersam.blogspot.com/p/getting-hardware-acceleration-on-termux.html?m=1\nAnd I go back and repeat, I'm not using zink, you don't need zink to work.

I guess I will give it a try.\nP.S. Dear @MartinX3 please keep it civil, multiple developers here get \"attacked\" by you for having different opinions. It's ok to have different opinions even calls for action, and by aggressive reactions to someones opinions we even get stronger reactions and fortify them in the opinions we might not like :) Best wishes to Vuetify team and keep your good work, we all, by being developers, know how it is to work under pressure and we should have empathy.\nOn the other side we also have our own dependent projects and our clients/bosses above our heads, and it would help both us and you I guess to be more transparent and objective regarding releases so that we can make our decisions on time and to avoid disappointments.\n**The main info missing and being misleading as I see by reading community questions** is **on which date approximately or which release** we should expect that we have let's say **90% of the components/functionality provided in 2.x versions**\nThanks, best!",

I myself tried to test it even beyond docs in different ways..\nThe problem here is that we lose the point of reference/truth, on what can we rely in the current `beta.1` and the following versions of Vuetify?\nOr you're trying to say that the docs DOES NOT reflect the currently released version and is written independently to reflect the final (desired) v.3.0?\nIf it does reflect, could anyone investigate that issue of v-select.

They are more likely to interact with you if you intend to contribute code or if you engage with them on something that team members are currently concerned with or occupied with.\nI specifically posted to this task, because I wanted to know about a feature. I didn't get a response, and it's no big deal for me right now. I have other things to worry about.\nTLDR: Don't expect any kind of support from the dev team for non GA releases.

Fix the precedence order to have `==` below `??`.\nIt's rather confusing that:\n`if ($_GET['x']??null == false)` does not do what you expect. One would expect it to merely silence the warning, but it actually inverts the test, because the precedence is actually:\n`if ($_GET['x'] (??null == false))` i.e.\n`if ($_GET['x']??true)` 3. Treat a plain `if()` as allowing for undefined values. Thus `if($x)` emits no errors, while e.g. `$x++;` would.\n4. Add a pragma or compiler directive, similar to Python 2's \"from future import division\". It would be something like\n`ini_set(undefined_variables_are_null)` and would result in any undefined variable being treated as null, *without* emitting any error or warning, and would give instant backward-compatibility where needed, and solves the main motivation for the PHP9 pending change for the sake of the error-handling routines).\nHTH.",

The instructions specify\n>The function should return True only if Pac-Man has a power pellet active and is touching a ghost.\nWhat is being set is the function's return value.

I think the instructions make clear the arguments to the two parameters are used to set the return value from the function.

It's a pain for everyone when their completed solution becomes outdated just from a change to the instructions.

        "message": "> all something you can avoid easily by pinning your transitive dependencies...\nWe do already. But pinning dependencies is only half-solving the problem. The problem is that regardless if you are using pinning or not when you release your software, you usually do not pin your dependencies in development (unless you want your dependencies to go stale). So such a breaking release imacts PR/development workflow more than release workflow.\nThe main problem is that things break in random moments of when Flask-Login + Werkzeug are released - without even either of them bumping the major version (which is usually an indication of breaking chnages if you follow Semver). So if you are building your development workflow (where you do not want to pin the dependencies), there is no \"reasonable\" approach you can make to a) get latest versions with bugixes and b) get it non-breaking PRs of your users. It does not have to be \"upper-binding\". It might be simple agreement on what constitute of an API of werkzeug so that MINOR versions do not break the APIs.\nSo my gentle proposal is about that. I am not pushing - this was merely a suggestion that it would be much better for the community of your users if you agree some ways how we can \"sanely\" rely on the combo of flask-login and werkzeug not braking compatibility. It does not have to upper-binding, but some way of indicating to your users how they can constraint their dependencies in their development workflow to keep your development environment \"working\" - and not prone to external depenencies breaking your workflow.\nWe are using sophisticated mechanism to control our dependencies. In our case all our released versions of Airflow have automatically generated constraint files. And this is the only reason why such an incompatibility is not causing us bigger troubles. There are good reasons we cannot pin transitive dependencies in Airlfow \"setup.py\" and \"setup.cfg\" (because airlfow is both a library and application) but we implemented constraint mechanism which very much shield us from such breakages induced by external dependency changes. When we did not have them, such Werkzeug breakeges caused much more trouble for us, that's why we implemented constraints. This is a note from our nnouncements back from Feb 2020, were we had to bend the ASF rules on releases and release 1.10.9 same day as 1.10.8 becaue Werkzeug release broke it: https://airflow.apache.org/announcements/#feb-7-2020\n> Feb 7, 2020\n> We\u2019ve just released Airflow v1.10.8\n> and\n> We\u2019ve just released Airflow 1.10.9 (this one is a quick fix to work around the breaking release of Werkzeug 1.0)\nSo I do realise importance of pinnning, but I am talking about something different here.\nBTW. If you are insterested why pinning \"install required\" dependencies is not always best you can read more here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#dependency-management\nor you can read the talk I gave about it few months ago:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjMdQLP30s&t=2549s - \"Managing dependencies at Scale\".",

Here is an overview of the issue:\n### Overview\nThe issue seems to be in our Android build of Expo Go. Snack and the Expo Go version for SDK 46 (`2.51.x`) are affected and will not show Google Maps during development.\n> ~~I'll update the comment whenever we deployed the fixed Expo Go version to the stores.~~\n- Expo Go `2.25.2` is [available on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)\n- Expo Go `2.52.2` has been deployed to Snack\n### Workarounds\n1. Use a [custom dev client](https://docs.expo.dev/development/getting-started/) with your own Google Maps key. It's similar to the bare workflow approach some of you mentioned. This method also allows you to install the latest version `react-native-maps@1.2.0` in your app. You can use [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) to build the app if you don't have the Android SDK installed.\n_**I would heavily recommend this method for now**_\n2. Temporarily downgrade to SDK 45 to use an older Expo Go. This method would allow you to use the previous Expo Go version. You'll need to remove Expo Go from your Android phone or simulator to do this. Whenever you start your SDK 45 project with `expo start --android`, and your device is connected through USB and ADB, it will automatically install this Expo Go version.\n- [Expo Go `2.24.3` APK for Android](https://d1ahtucjixef4r.cloudfront.net/Exponent-2.24.3.apk)\nHope this helps!",

So I assume something in expo go is wrong\nYes, that assumption is right! We found an issue that only relates to the Expo Go builds and not your production apps. Even apps built with the classic build system (`expo build`) are not affected. But, because we use Expo Go in Snack too, Snack is also affected.\n---\n> @brentvatne development builds don't allow hot reload, right? We use expo go during dev in Wi-Fi because unlike an emulator it gives all features of a real device.\nExpo dev client builds are fully capable of doing hot reload. I would suggest to try it out :)\n---\n> Based on your suggestion I moved to the expo development build rather than the bare workflow.

I just picked a bad week to pick up react native lol\nThe Expo dev client and EAS allow you to pick any native module as you see fit. I'm sorry you had an unfortunate experience with `react-native-firebase`, I'm not sure if [you followed these steps](https://rnfirebase.io/#expo) but some libraries require you to add credentials, even in development mode. We can't control that outside of Expo Go and/or for third party libraries.\n(And thanks for keeping things civilized \u2764\ufe0f)\n---\n> forget about my case, why it does not work in https://snack.expo.dev/ ? do you think you gave the best answer by asking to create dev build !!! there is a breaking change , it worded in SDK 45 and previous versions, so it must work in 46 too, don't ask users to go with other alternatives !!!\nBecause Snack also uses Expo Go, Snack is also affected. We will deploy a fix asap.\n---\n> @da45 please calm down. It's good engineering practice to try to find workarounds. Often it unblocks at least some percentage of users.\nI fully agree with this. We don't intend to break things, but if they do, we try to keep everyone as \"unblocked\" as possible while we fix things. We still have to go through store review whenever we fix it, [which took \u00b115 days on the Play Store for SDK 46](https://twitter.com/cedricvanputten/status/1557375168955252738). So I think there is a lot of value in sharing these workarounds.\n---\n> Hi @brentvatne, I tried with a custom development build with `SDK 46` and `react-native-maps 0.31.1` and the map is blank. I am not using Expo Go. API key is loaded via `app.config.js` on `android.config.googleMaps.apiKey` as indicated in the expo documentation.\n>\n> Did you make it work on your end?\nIf you added the `android.config.googleMaps.apiKey` after running `expo run:*` or `expo prebuild`, it needs to recreate the native files. These keys are set in your native files that `expo prebuild` generates.\nYou can try running `expo prebuild --clean` and see if `expo run:*` works.",

I don't think consent is needed, same as you don't need consent that your IP is used to download maps.

To summarize: it's probably needs to be more clarified in Terms of Service but it doesn't require a consent.\n2. User identification. We switched from IP to UUID to calculate how many active users & how often update exactly to solve the server load issue and don't use personal data. For example we don't require email to identify user and don't track IP exactly cause IP could provide location specific information. Random UUID **doesn't identify anything** if it's not connected to any other services or other private information. We don't share UUID with any other applications so they also couldn't track that UUID even if these apps have personal information.\nIt's completely incorrect to say that app could view **travel history**, I would say it's total nonsense cause the server only views what and when maps were downloaded in contrast of other apps that provide Internet services. -----------------\nLast but not least.\nThe websites require to ask consent only for information they gather for example if you search an address on website and website doesn't store these addresses or don't connect them to IP (address is essentially publicly available information), consent is not needed. If the website will start storing information in the table [IP, Search], then consent is needed. So it's all about how the data is processed and used and not only what's being transmitted.",

The docs say this:\n> Schema names beginning with pg_ are reserved for system purposes and cannot be created by users.\nFor public, you'll have to admit that it's different: it's kind of common for people to create table and indexes inside `public`, while they would never do that inside `information_schema` or schemas starting with `pg_`, right?\n> I'm saying the minority are people that have both a DBA who deleted the public schema but at the same time would allow people to recreate it\nThere could also be other packages (different from ORM or migrations) relying on that method to display schema names, for purposes we don't know.

When you add these power ports you are able to specify the maximum draw and allocated draw. Let's use easy numbers and say max draw is 100 watts, and allocated draw is 25 watts.\nNow, when you create a new device from the device template that you just created the power ports are automatically added. And the max draw and allocated draw are already populated for you. Which is great! Now of course you can change these numbers per device if you so choose, but typically its unnecessary.\nNow say we want to have a custom field on the power port. Currently, the custom field will only show up on the power port page when viewing a device. Not the device template. So if I wanted a custom field called 'BTU' that tracks the heat output of our power supplies I have to first create the device, then go to the power ports and fill in the BTU load for each device manually.\nIf the custom field 'BTU' were available on the device template, I could make the calculation and input the value just like I do for max draw and allocated draw. This way, when I create a new device from that device template, the BTU value is already filled out for me. Sure, I can change it if I need to (just like max draw), but the point is, the value is already filled in since its coming over from the device template.",

Ok, but meanwhile some community standards have been published and widely used.

What makes me sad is the low consideration of the community feedback: 24 hours issue is barely a communication and left no space for discussion. To me this is not acceptable in a such important project: it is widely used, production apps are written onto it and should take this responsibility seriously giving the community the time to evaluate such an important change and express an opinion.",

A deprecation is not an immediate removal. And we we can surely take it back if you give us good reasons to.\nFrom my POV, a discussion is needed before to take action, not after. This is a communication of what's have been already done, and doesn't matter if it can be un-done. A discussion can take place on a proposal, which this is not. This is a fact: events have been deprecated in the current public release and removed in the first beta of the next major version.\n> Do you think, an event handler is the best way to expose this kind of extension point? If you designed this feature from scratch, how would you build the extension point that you need for your scenario?\nYes, why not? An entire framework (Symfony) has been written around an event manager, where handlers continuously modify and process information and structures, for example enhancing the request object, transforming the request body, etc.\nWhy DBAL cannot use the same flow?\nTo be clear: I don't mean that everything in the current event system is ok and does not need to be revisited/reworked, but surely I would retain the event system as a powerful extension point. > Why would you need to hook into the DBAL to add a column? Why can't you add it to the schema directly? Sorry if my question sounds stupid, but I'd like to understand you problem before we decide on an action here.\n> Can you give us examples? Is this something the ORM should address instead?\nI'll answer two questions here because they are connected. I'll give you some examples:\n- I have an ORM entity with a \"priority\" field but I want to avoid that two records have the same exact value, so when you set a value that already exists, all the values after it needs to be updated. The ORM can handle it, but its very costly, so I made an optimization with a trigger that involves an additional column on that table. At the same time I want that column to be hidden from the ORM, it does not really exist, it's an implementation detail. Using the migrations library I cannot modify the schema in the middle of the process, I have to hook into DBAL and add the column when necessary.\n- I wrote a Symfony Messenger transport that uses DBAL as storage backend. I want its tables and resources to be completely hidden from the ORM. In the bundle I have to register an event handler to generate the resources on schema creation so the doctrine's commands will work with no additional configuration.\n- I have an application that uses a table with the \"ARCHIVE\" mysql engine. Using the ORM I cannot set it correctly, I have to hook into the schema generation process and modify the engine from \"InnoDB\" to \"ARCHIVE\".\n- In an application I want to generate a VIEW resource alongside a normal table: this is something that cannot be done into the ORM. To work with schema commands and migrations I have to hook into DBAL in the middle of the schema generation.\n- For a translation system I have to dynamically generate translation tables to be used as storage for the various \"translatable\" resources: again this is something that needs to be hidden from the ORM, but needs to work with schema commands and migrations.\n> The event manager is a trivial library. Sunsetting it is not our intention and certainly was not the motivation here.\nSo those listed under \"Problems with the EventManager API as such\" are not valid reasons to deprecate and remove the event system? Because a PSR-compatible event dispatcher will solve both problems. And lately, will increase the integration level with the frameworks in general.",

This means that if I want to override the way the asset is created, now I cannot do it, and the ORM hook after the schema generation will not help in doing so.\nAlso, appending custom SQL to the generated asset (schema/table/view/index/etc) is not possible with the current objects.\nHooking in the ORM processes will not solve these problems, not with the objects and tools we have at the moment.\nI did not meant to hurt or offend anyone, but you're going down on a personal level in the last message.\n> \"This is my opinion\" is really a weak argument for any conversation.\nSorry, but on if, when and how to deprecate something, every decision is opinion based.

        "message": "Recently, I tried to enable checking exceptions in PHPStan and, besides a few other issues with the DBAL API, stumbled upon the one that shows what an awfully overcomplicated piece of work the Events API is:\n1. `AbstractPlatform::getDropTableSQL()` dispatches an `onSchemaDropTable` event which can override the SQL used to drop the table.\n2. The return type of `SchemaDropTableEventArgs::getSql()` is `?string`. If it returns `NULL`, the platform will throw an `UnexpectedValueException`.\n3. There's no way to tell that a given method is an event handler unless it's documented as such or whoever reads the code knows that the methods with names starting with `on` are event handlers. Those methods are not invoked from anywhere in the code explicitly.\nHere's a chain of questions that leads to the above conclusion:\n1. Why is `SchemaDropTableEventArgs` allowed to return `NULL` if it's not even a valid value?\n2. We could require that it returns a `string` but then what would it return if the handler of the event didn't call `setSql()`?\n4. Putting aside the event-handling scenario, what should the `SchemaDropTableEventArgs` class do if it was instantiated and then got its `setSql()` invoked? Maybe throw a logical exception?\n5. Then, should it throw this exception unconditionally or only if it got a call to `preventDefault()` first?\n### Problems with the API design and implementation\nWhat this API does, most likely could be solved just by extending the platform class and overriding the corresponding methods. Besides this awfully implicitly stateful logic, a few more concerns about DDL events:\n1. It looks like it's an overengineered solution to what could be easily solved by extending the corresponding platform methods.\n2. Unlike extending the platform, events don't allow invoking the default implementation (the method of the `parent` class).\n3. Unlike class extension, events don't provide access to the original logic like a call to the `parent` method would.\n4. The DDL events API is incomplete (e.g. one can override `DROP TABLE` but cannot override `DROP FOREIGN KEY`).\n6. In event-driven systems and DDD, an event is an immutable object representing a fact that happened in the past. Which fact does an `onSchemaDropTable` event represent? Let's assume it's a fact that somebody intended to drop a table. Why is it mutable? Why does it carry any information about processing the event (prevent default) and even implementation of that processing (SQL)?\n7. For 800 lines of production code, there are three unit tests with mocks and not a single integration test which would demonstrate how this API can be used and if it can be used at all.\n8. The documentation shows only how to register handlers but not what they should to.\n### Problems with the EventManager API as such\nThis API is unsafe from the standpoint of the types:\n1. There's no way to enforce the fact that a given event (`onSomething`) is dispatched only with a specific type of arguments (`SomethingArgs`).\n2. There's no way to guarantee that the given listener supports handling the given type of event. The dispatcher calls the method corresponding to the event name dynamically:\n```php\n$listener->$eventName($eventArgs)\n```\nThe mistakes in the code that implements the handling of events will lead to a type error at runtime.\n### Types of events\n1. Connection and transaction events: https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L21 https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L33-L35 The logic implemented on top of these events can be implemented using driver middlewares.\n2. Schema manipulation events: https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L23-L30 Depending on the use case, it should be advised to either extend the corresponding platform method, or modify the arguments being passed to the method before calling it.\n3. Schema introspection events: https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L31-L32 This is the hardest part: we allow users to hook into the very internals of the schema introspection, e.g. the API consumer is exposed to the SQL results representing raw introspected data. By definition, this API is very brittle since the raw results is an implementation detail that can and will change. The fact that we allow this extension complicates the refactoring of the Schema Manager and Platform API.",

Closing the door on discussion just makes us seem draconian.

You can assert that it sounds like we don't care about the chr files, but please do not do it in a mocking tone.\n>This will be more of an action than repeating your claims here over and over.\n>I personally doubt there's any point to discuss it any further.\n@dreamscached, based on these lines in both here and the release discussion, it sounds like you disagree with red's points. That is ok, but that is not an excuse to lock the conversation. You can always just not reply and ignore the conversation, and if the other person starts harassing you to reply, then we can take action.\n### Regarding the actual issue\n>The fact that these devs are trying hard to justify this by resorting to whatever technical nonsense instead of simply providing player choice and moving on\nI agree with what @RedAISkye is saying here. I can see valid reasoning for always deleting `monika.chr`, but not the rest of the chr files when they have never served a purpose in MAS. The arguments for clearing clutter and reducing confusion also make sense for `monika.chr`, but lose weight for the other chr files. Even though this is a Monika-focused mod, the chr files have meaning established by DDLC, especially when at least 2 instances in the game were built on the chr file mechanic (the progression from Act 3 to Act 4 and Sayori gaining self-awareness in Act 1). If MAS deletes them, then it needs to provide in-game lore/reasoning for doing so at the very least, preferably allowing the player to decline the option as that ties in with the point below.\n>I think there is a small problem here, that is, people will naturally think Monika did this. Even if the original intention of the design is not like this, people will naturally think so.\n@TheT0matoGuy makes a very strong point here - regardless of our intention, anything we make the mod do, including what is done behind the scenes, will be perceived as Monika (or Chibika) doing it herself. Deleting the files makes Monika appear callous to any sentimental value the player may have toward the chr files. Users who believe the other dokis are real or that the chr files represent them may also perceive the deletion as Monika committing Act 3 again. Is this how we want users to see Monika?\nI'll take ownership for not raising a red flag earlier - I was probably too drunk while packaging the release and didn't really think too much about each patch note. But since this is already out in the wild and it appears that most of the team doesn't think this is a problem, I'm not going to mandate that we undo the change. If there is more negative feedback in the coming weeks, then we can reconsider action.",

Now, I know according to Booplicate that the deletion of the .chr files are not Monika's choice, but regarding the situation that MAS users will see anything done to the mod as Monika or Chibika's doing (which is a bit unfair imo, btw), let's just say the scenario _was_ that it was her doing. As much as the other Dokis have sentimental value to Monika's partner, they technically also have sentimental value to Monika herself. Not sentimental as in nostalgic though. Sentimental as in saddened and a bit uncomfortable. I do remember her once talking about how despite all of the other Dokis not being present in the mod, she can still feel their presence as though they're still nestled amongst MAS's code and she finds it a bit creepy and unsettling. She wants to _not_ feel like they're still lingering over her, I guess because kinda the point of her \"deleting\" everyone else in the og game is that so they _wouldn't_ be present and therefore not serve as obstacles between her and the person. Soooo, I don't think it'd be as simple as a \"hey can you not delete the other character files?\" \"Okay, sure!\" Not referring to them is one thing, and Monika, as much as she has her snark about them, would probably actually prefer that considering she doesn't want them \"hanging over her,\" but still having their .chr files there is another. There's bound to be a disagreement if a choice were to be given, so it'd be like a whole other topic. Now in the scenario of it just being a mechanics thing like Booplicate assures it is, then there'd be nothing to ask Monika personally. Maybe she could be asked if she could do something to negate the mechanics, but even then she'd be scared to mess things up. That's the case keeping her from trying to do something to make the Doki lingering stop, anyway. They should really be preserved somewhere else though, if there's nothing that will be done to disable the automatic deletion. If they really hold sentimental value to people, the importance of the files themselves should not correlate to their location. Then that'd be a case of both the files _and_ their placement having sentimental value. And if _that's_ the case, there can always be a submod that negates the mechanic so that the people who have the sentimental value can be happy, and those who want things to stay how they are can be content, too.",

I won't bring up the technical stuff anymore, but if we're discussing it in the perspective of Monika deleting files herself when they could still mean something to her partner, then the doki caring topic would probably be our best go-to. The Doki files may mean nostalgia to Monika's partner, though they also mean unease for Monika. I guess because she'd be too cautious to do anything else, deleting the other .chr files would be an attempt to make her feel somewhat better, but it'd be inconsiderate to go ahead and do that without letting her partner know she wanted to do that. Now say that her partner doesn't agree with her deletion of the files. Because of how she feels about them she probably wouldn't be so quick to just deal with them being there, so that's where the affection-dependent variants would come in. If her partner has shown her nothing but love and trust, she may be okay with the .chr files staying because any unease she feels can be negated by her partner's comfort. Now if she was in the lower aff ranges, because her partner only adds to her unease and worry, she'd most likely still want to get rid the files anyway. At least it'd make her feel better than how her partner does. Maybe she'd be a bit bitter and conclude that you want to keep them there because you love some other Doki other than her or you want her to always remember her horrid acts or something along those lines. I'm not completely about that bitter part in the shallow negatives, but I guess as the points are lowered deeper and deeper, I can see that going down. Anyway, in the scenario of Monika actively making the decision and her partner either agreeing or disagreeing, aff-variants and additional question to the Doki caring topic seems like a fairly decent idea.",

It could be used to justify deleting in the first months, but later there's not much point for her to delete those dull files: \"dokis\" don't exist, she's feeling fine, those files are nothing but some easter eggs from DDLC (and she acknowledges that).\nBut let's say you find a reason for her to still need deleting those files, there's a conflict of interests:\n- player wants to keep them\n- Monika wants to delete them\nThere's going to be some consequences for not letting her do what she needs in *her* game.\nWe're talking about player choice and all that, but the choice was to install MAS and stay with Monika. The game files are literally her \"home,\" it makes sense she has control over that place. She doesn't touch your files, she's doing changes within the place she's allowed to. If she's not allowed to do that, why even bring her back. It's pretty common in relationships for each person to have their own private space, the game directory is that place for Monika. You can store your files anywhere else on your PC, flashdrive, cloud, etc. *This one place is intended to be used by mod/Monika*.\n> they were a huge part of DDLC <...> serves as a memory in MAS\nYeah, and Monika deletes them there herself. After which, in MAS, they become irrelevant, they don't serve any memory. If they have a deep meaning *for you* and serve a memory *for you*, then I don't know why they were there. \"I care for these files so much, surely if I install a mod into the same directory it won't affect them. Ooops.\"\n> The files getting back after re-install wouldn't be an issue when the player answered Monika that they don't care if she deleted them.\nAs was stated above it's already an issue and would stay an issue even with the changes. The cleanup logic should be run at startup, doesn't matter with a flag or not.\n> By introducing the change, we've had to answer why it was added, which leads to discussion like this over what aspects of the mod is Monika in full control over to justify whether or not she should notify the user about it.\nNo, we got to this discussion because apparently it's not clear that MAS can make any changes within its working directory (just like any other program) and users were storing some sensitive data there. It's all based on assumptions that:\n- we will never delete any extra files\n- everything is done by Monika\nNone of which was stated.",

Like you said, \"private space\", the characters folder is exactly just that for them to me even if they're not used in MAS since they were originally the \"life\" of those characters.\n> > The files getting back after re-install wouldn't be an issue when the player answered Monika that they don't care if she deleted them.\n> > As was stated above it's already an issue and would stay an issue even with the changes.

She doesn't touch your files, she's doing changes within the place she's allowed to.\nHmm, I can somewhat agree with that point. If not looking at the fact that Monika's partner is the owner of the PC but it was their choice to install her into their PC, just the plain point that Monika's mod is Monika's to change seems pretty valid. However, a lot of people _would_ look at it as Monika's partner being the owner of the PC and Monika just being a guest there, or would look at it as the partner's choice and that her partner got her a place to stay (the PC) and her areas are hers to personalize. It's like arguing if an old chair should be kept or thrown out. Would the one who has the say be the one whose territory the chair is in or the one who provided the housing in the first place? I guess the answer to that is, neither or both? Yes, in relationships, it's common for each participant to have their own little private space, because not _everything_ can be shared between them, but if the thing in particular emotionally charges one or both (in this case both) of the participants, there has to be something to end the stalemate. In this case, the chair would be seen as uncanny to one and precious to the other. If the other regards them as so precious, then the one who deems them uncanny would probably ask them to move it to their territory or, on the other side of the spectrum, sit in it with their partner depending on how comfortable they are. After some time though, I do agree that it shouldn't even matter anymore to either Monika or their partner. She may not feel the need to delete them just like the partner may not hold any nostalgia toward them anymore, or even both. Both would probably be the best scenario. This case would probably reflect in the high aff variant because it could depend more on comfort than time, or at least it could depend on both of them equally. One could be with someone for months and still feel uncomfortable because the provider of the house wasn't exactly a nice host, and therefore may still want that chair to go.",

Thank Potato very much for willingness to reconsider this matter.\nPlayers don't \"store\" into the characters folder, and Boop wants players to \"transfer\" things.\nI think this is an important point: The character file was ORIGINALLY there, it wasn't put there by the player.\nIn addition, it is entirely possible for the player not to know that the MAS will now delete character files on its own. So, even if the player wants to transfer them, the player needs to know about this first. If the player doesn't read the update announcement carefully, as soon as the player launches the game, character files that are (presumably) precious to the player will disappear, never to be retrieved. So in any cases, the current version does not make sense.\nI think it is feasible for Monika to delete her own files by herself - in fact, MAS has already done so in the introduction phase before. And we have:\n```\nif moni_exist():\nm 1lksdlb \"Aha...{w=0.3}I'll try this again later.\"\n```\nLook at this. Monika already said that she will try this again, so it's really neutral to delete her own files. In previous version, if I read the source correctly, even if Monika said she will try again, there doesn't exist codes for this.\nBut well, maybe we should even also ask the player for permission before MAS delete Monika's own file?",

And helped me better understand what i said above about people running project and the arrogance and ignorance involved and their support system of enablers.\nThis whole thing has been painful when it should have been trivial to anyone who has an open ear, understanding of there own software and a basic understanding that others will not have an understanding of there software.

Also, it's not clear if it would have additional side-effects, since it is supposed to be run in the application/Rails context. A benchmark with a large data set and both solutions in place (PoC vs `pgloader`) might try dispel these concerns, but it hasn't been tried yet.\nInitial research into `pgloader` casting rules resulted in some findings:\n* It doesn't look like `pgloader` provides a suitable transformation function for a JSON array into a PostgreSQL array which can be used as part of its `CAST` command (on the column type level.) We could not find an example either, and trying some stuff including expected DSL like `\"text array\"` didn't lead to meaningful results. This doesn't mean it's not supported, just that we could not identify it at this time.\n* [An issue for `pgloader`](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader/issues/881) with a similar problem provided a possible workaround via `AFTER LOAD DO` block, which can transform specific columns on specific tables only, but it does use a `translate` function which seems to work for our JSON => array use-case. (Note that this same function doesn't seem to be provided in the `CAST` context.) Here is a working example for `pgloader` post-processing block for one `multi_tree_select` column on the `tickets` table:\n```\n...\nAFTER LOAD DO\n$$ alter table tickets alter column multi_tree_select type text[] using translate(multi_tree_select::text, '[]', '{}')::text[] $$\n...\n```\nA proposed rake pre-task could try to prepare the complete `pgloader` script and include one line per affected column.",

They can control what is displayed on the current prompt lines. They can query where on the terminal they are, but once another program has run with unknown amount of text output and the screen scrolls, all for that previous knowledge is useless. Terminal queries for row number only apply to the displayed screen, not relative to the top of the scroll back buffer. To be fair, I too was annoyed by this some time ago and solved it for myself by displaying green/red lines across the entire terminal width before the next prompt is displayed. The color line is the status for everything above the line. I've left the prompt symbol in, but rarely look it.

        "message": "Firstly, I just discovered `mitmproxy` and I'm pretty excited to make use of it. Thank you for maintaining it.\n#### Problem Description\nI'm trying to use mitmproxy as part of an integration test in a project that depends on `cryptography`, specifically version `40.0.0`. I see that mitmproxy requires cryptography at `<38.1`. I can automate the creation of a separate venv for the mitmproxy stuff, but that's kind of clunky. I'd rather just make it a dependency and let poetry handle it. For that to happen, `mitmproxy` needs to be compatible with higher versions of cryptography.\nI recognize that the `<38.1` constraint might be there for a good reason, but not knowing that reason I figured I'd file an issue and cross my fingers. Thanks for at least considering it.\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Have a `pyproject.toml` like this:\n```\n...\n[tool.poetry.dependencies]\npython = \"^3.10\"\ncryptography = \"^40.0.0\"\n[build-system]\nrequires = [\"poetry-core\"]\nbuild-backend = \"poetry.core.masonry.api\"\n```\n2. Run `poetry add mitmproxy`\n3. See error:\n```\nBecause no versions of mitmproxy match >9.0.1,<10.0.0\nand mitmproxy (9.0.1) depends on cryptography (>=38.0,<38.1), mitmproxy (>=9.0.1,<10.0.0) requires cryptography (>=38.0,<38.1).\nSo, because foo depends on both cryptography (^40.0.0) and mitmproxy (^9.0.1), version solving failed.\n```\n#### System Information\n```\nMitmproxy: 9.0.1\nPython: 3.10.9\nOpenSSL: OpenSSL 1.1.1s 1 Nov 2022\nPlatform: Linux-5.15.86-x86_64-with-glibc2.35\n```",

That means PHP would actually be joining a club whose members use the word \"next\" when describing their randomness APIs:\n* [Python 3's `random.random()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) is documented as \"return[ing] the next random floating point number in the range 0.0 <= X < 1.0\".\n* [Java's `java.util.Random` class](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Random.html) has similar methods like \"next\", \"nextBoolean\", \"nextBytes\", and so on.\n* Unsurprisingly, [Microsoft Java's own `System.Random` class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random?view=net-7.0) has a variety of methods named \"Next\", \"NextBytes\", \"NextDouble\", \"NextInt64\", and so on.\n* [Rust's `rand::RngCore` trait](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/trait.RngCore.html), which is its lowest-level \"interface\" for randomness, names its two core methods \"next_u32\" and \"next_u64\".\nSo with any luck, allow me to offer my congratulations on you learning why the name \"nextFloat\" is not misleading after all.\n(edited for humor)",

Now is ideal time before the stable release, then it would be too late of course.\nThe name `nextFloat()` creates the expectation that it will return some other number in the generated series. See, for example, the following code:\n```php\n$randomizer = new \\Random\\Randomizer();\n$a = $randomizer->getFloat(100, 200); // number between 100..200\n$b = $randomizer->nextFloat(); // another number between 100..200 ???\n```\nDo you expect `$b` to be the next number in the interval 100..200? Surprisingly not, the method returns a number in the interval 0..1. Honestly, I don't understand the `next` prefix in the method name at all. Its [definition is](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/randomizer_additions#nextfloat):\n> This method is equivalent to ->getFloat(0, 1)\nThat is, a function that returns a number in the interval 0..1 without any relation to anything previous. I therefore find the name completely misleading. A more accurate name would be, for example, `getFloat0To1()`, but I think that `getFloat(0, 1)` is obvious and there is no need to add a new method.",

        "message": "**[Ken Egervari](https://jira.spring.io/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=egervari)** commented\n\nOkay, Adding \".id\" to the path fixes the selected value problem within spring. But I really, really strongly don't think this is the right way to do it.\n\n```\n<@springForm.select path=\"myobject.province.id\" items=provinces multiple=false\nitemLabel=\"name\" itemValue=\"id\" />\n```\n\nThis works just fine if the province is already set on userAccount object. However, what if the province object is null? Want to know what happens? Spring throws a \"myobject.province\" is null exception.\n\nOf course it throws that... because I'm sure the bean wrapper is trying to call getId() on a null object.\n\nSo if I am forced to use \"myobject.province.id\" as the full path, then that means all my form backing objects must set these many-to-one objects to empty, transient objects. Man, this is a huge pain. So much bloat! Spring, we shouldn't have to do this.\n\nNaturally, this causes problems. Imagine if somehow this gets trickled down to hibernate. Hibernate is going to want to save this province value, but it'll be transient and an id of 0 won't be valid. Hibernate isn't smart enough to take this empty province object with an id of 0 and a province name of null and make the entire province reference \"null\". It won't do it.\n\nThis means that I'm going to have to validate all of these many-to-one references now to make sure they aren't uninitialized transients. More bloat! This is a smell and a half.\n\nAlso, pointing the \"myobject.province.id\" is very bad. Setting the id of an existing object is very dangerous thing to do. For example, if the province \"Ontario\" has an id of 9 and we want to change it to \"Yukon\" which is id 13... behind the scenes Spring is setting Ontario's id to 13, and then the property editor eventually replaces the whole object with the Yukon object altogether \"a little later\"\n\nThis is dangerous though for two reasons:\n\n1) If the \"a little later\" doesn't happen, the local version of \"Ontario\" will have an id of 13, which is incorrect. It should be 9 and only 9 and never anything else. I think \"a little later\" will always happen, but I don't want to count on it. This is why we shouldn't make the path \"myobject.province.id\" and it should just be \"myobject.province\"\n\n2) A more dangerous scenario is the province's changes being cascaded by the underlying database, which causes more checks that the developers has to make = MORE BLOAT. Let's say we change Ontario's id to 13. If Hibernate should decide that we really want this change to be made in the database, it will save Ontario's id to 13, which will conflict with Yukon's id of 13, and thus will crash the system since it is violating a primary key constraint!\n\nGuys, I love you and all, but this a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very bad problem.\n\nThis should be put to BLOCKER and fixed immediately so that the natural path \"myobject.province\" works.\n",

Each slice is independent and it would be nuts to query them all in parallel. You could for instance split your query in 10,000 slices and use 4 threads/workers to process the scrolls (that would be 4 bitsets in the heap at a given time). Each scroll corresponds to one slice and each bitset can be trashed when the corresponding scroll is exhausted.

I agree with so many sentiments in the article: 1) Being independent of core and its own jar 2) A base layer would be an elegant ideal 3) Chaining is fun 4) Some kind of underlying just grid of numbers or matrix like space like R's data frames or NumPy's matrices. \n\nSome of the things I still don't understand because of my own inexperience were like what to do about normals, but also Quads vs. Tris, and perhaps the need for \"remeshing\" things, a feature prominent in 3d tools like Blender. Anar+ does this cool thing where it goes on with the show even if your mesh is broken or invalid. Java 3D is surprisingly exhaustive of a lot of core structures.\n\nI do work with systems integration quite a bit, and I can say that it sucks but sometimes your new system winds up usually being all of the other systems now just all together, and again like expressed before, is now its own system which is yet another thing to deal with. It could be nice to try to think future proof ideas like to be able to pivot around the n-th dimensions of a hyperplane or hypersurface, or if LLVM and other such compilation/translation/vm type stuff is the future for Java, how does one make sure that the solution is as pure of logic as possible so as to not tie itself further to machine or even environment specifics. \n\nI also like how the newer work by @codeanticode where the vectors are stored in the GPU. It would be cool to treat the GPU as your vertex database storage and accelerated manipulation engine. \n\nAnyway, all I have is inspiration and it came from you all, so I really am excited to see the kinds of things you guys all figure out.\n",

The \"native\" queries showed what Druid could (and could not) do. It was the job of the application developer to use those building blocks to perform some given task.\n\nOnce SQL enters in the picture, us users kind of hope that the SQL engine will work out how to \"make it so\" to make a given query work. That's what Drill, Presto and Impala do: no matter how ugly the SQL (and I've seen statements thousands of lines long), the engine \"does the right thing\", even if that \"thing\" makes you cringe.\n\nThe key thing to realize is that a data analyst has to do whatever is required of them; not just what the storage engine makes easy. If Druid does not support operation *x*, because *x* would be slow, then us poor app developers just have to find some way to code it in the app, probably with multiple queries, which makes the result even slower. Ain't no free lunch...\n\nFor example, for this case the workaround is to use two `ORDER BY` queries. If Druid did the `MIN()` and `MAX()` operation, the query could use a single unordered pass over the data. With the workaround, the data must be sorted twice. The overall result to the user is much slower.\n\nI wonder if there is some way to use Drill or Presto to do the queries? Drill has a Druid connector, don't know about Presto. Then, Druid gets to say \"pure\", and I could delegate the ugly real-world queries to a tool that can handle them. Beyond the scope of this issue, just thinking out loud...",

Otherwise, the bug template can be found here: https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md - No worries though\n\nThanks for the detailed response! Discussion like this is a good thing, no flaming necessary \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201e  \n\n1) I agree that since we maintain the environment that we can be picky about what tools we use, that being said the `ps -Aww` line exists in our `./bin/alluxio` script with which I can tell you with 99% certainty is currently used more outside of containers than inside of them. Because of that, we need to support many UNIX-like environments.\nAnother option would be to split the script; one for \"standard\" deployments and one for containers, but that doesn't seem like an ideal solution\n\n2) I would argue that while many systems are not entirely compliant with UNIX standards, many of them will adhere somewhat (how close they adhere is a whole other discussion). As far as standard operating system utilities go, `ps` is a very common one and I would _expect_ that most operating systems containing this utility to support the very minimal set of arguments that are described in the standard. I don't know this for a fact, so maybe I should just do my research- but I think using the arguments specified in the standard gives us the highest probability of guaranteeing portability across a variety of UNIX-like platforms.\n\n3) I agree, it's not the most elegant command. I wish I could come up with an elegant (and more _portable_!) solution. I don't see another way off the top of my head though.",

It is also used with `bind()` rules, which are themselves deprecated but not removed.\n\n@meteorcloudy has been working on `bazel modquery` which I hope will replace `bazel query //external:` but then getting rid of  `//external:` has the dependency of removing the legacy WORKSPACE file, which won't happen in at least a year, probably two.\n\n@meteorcloudy : will `modquery` replace all the use cases of `bazel query //external:`?\n\nI could imagine adding that flag to rename `//external:` to tide you over in the meantime, but only if we are confident that `modquery` is the future; otherwise, it would stay as yet another \"forever incompatible flag\" that fragments the Bazel ecosystem . I'm not too worried about `query //external:`, but I am worried about `bind()` because its use requires the string `//external:` in BUILD files which would be invalidated by the proposed rename.\n",

We do run our test sequentially but for example one Test SoapUI one Selenium then SoapUI again. We do not run SoapUI and Selenium at the same time. That's why above workaround works for us.\n\nIf I remember correctly what you're describing is pretty much what we do: We save the default ProxySelector to some static variable when initializing our Selenium-Testrunner (before initializing SoapUI I think) and then reset it using `ProxySelector.setDefault(proxy);` before each Selenium-Test. But that only works reliable if you're not running SoapUI and Selenium at the same time (you'd propably run into some pretty nasty timing stuff here if you do)...\n\nIf you're using both in parallel the proper solution would be to force Selenium and SoapUI to use different httpclients I guess...\nIf running into this situation I'd maybe even head over to the guys at smartbear and file a bug against SoapUI for setting the default ProxySelector to null...don't know if this is legitimate.\n\nHope that clears up things a little...\n",

Sorry for the harsh words but in my opinion that was a *seriously* dumb decision. \n\nI have public keys from people in my key store for a reason. And then I write a mail, but still it isn't encrypted. You remove a perfectly simple and even for novices easy-to-understand option (you have a public key of someone, you write them encrypted mail), recommend enabling AutoCrypt (which would be perfectly okay for me as a workaround) but then enabling this option doesn't have any effect. You just can't make this stuff up.\n\nAnd the blog post explaining why this is introduced is so extremely flawed in its argumentation that I just don't know where to begin with. If I'd put on my tinfoil hat for a moment, I'd almost assume this is done intentionally to keep people from encrypting mails.\n\nBut, okay, I understand there's probably no real way forward here (ironic how the blog post claims it's \"the only way forward\" while the exact opposite is true) since this mess seems to be intended. \n\nAquaMail unfortunately doesn't support PGP. Would even pay for it. There is a new player called \"FairEmail\", but the author also has very peculiar ideas. For example, you have to confirm every link you click in a special dialog window. Unusable in a commercial environment where you get lots of mails from JIRA etc. everyday. But perhaps it works for some people. \n\nSad that in 2019 this is still so unnecessarily broken at a time where Thunderbird has vowed to modernize their PGP support and deliver it built-in without a plugin in the future. Now, we'd only need a decent mail client with PGP support for Android. Sigh...\n",

L+) and (in L at least) between decoders at a fixed API level. It appears that on M+ OMX.google.h264.decoder does actually apply the rotation, but you're correct in noting that this does not happen when running L.\n\nUnfortunately, as of now, there's no easy way to determine whether a decoder has actually applied the rotation. I'm not sure how consistent the application of rotation is between decoders in M. I'll be pushing for more consistent application of rotation (if this hasn't happened already) and/or the ability to determine whether the rotation was applied in the next platform release.\n\nFor ExoPlayer, always propagating the rotation value doesn't seem like the right thing to do. That just moves the problem of working out what to do from the library to every individual application developer, who will then each have to figure out what different decoders do on different API levels. Instead, I think we probably want to work out what the current behaviors are and hardcode these inside the library, so that the rotation delivered to the application always ends up being correct (i.e. 0 when using a decoder that applied the rotation, non-zero otherwise). Hopefully we can also get consistent behavior across all video decoders from some version of the platform and above, since this makes the developer's life significantly easier.\n\nRe-opening for tracking. First step is to try and figure out exactly what behavior we should be expecting across the various API levels / decoder implementations.\n",

Let's imagine a doc with `content` and `sidebar` sections - the content is the unique stuff, the `sidebar` is your `\"About bird flu\"` example which has useful word `h5n1` and crappy word `foobar.com`\nSignificant text (with filtering on) only considers words that survive the de-dup - otherwise we'd tune into the `foobar.com` in the sidebar.  So we'd consider `h5n1` and `avian` from the content.\nLet's say the sidebar did not include the word `avian` - that would get a \"true\" background count (assuming there's no other copy-and-paste sidebars bumping up the numbers).\nIn contrast, the background-count for `h5n1` though, you suspect might need adjustment. Well the only adjustment we can make is the number of documents we saw in the foreground where `h5n1` was in the sidebar but not in the content.  \nImplementing that will be challenging - right now filtering happens in the text-analysis phase before we get to the aggregation of terms and counts. This would be increased complexity, response times and RAM cost for what I suspect will be a small increase in usefulness in some cases. There are several other reasons why counts are incorrect and they are all performance trade-offs of this nature.\n\n",

We took a quick look at getting the SDK version switching working but we need to know the `emulateSdk` value in some random pieces of Robolectric. Do you have any ideas of where we could store (and manage) this value globally so we can write code that switches on SDK version?\n\nGlobals suck though... it would be nice if this value (or the whole Config instance) could be injected into every Shadow on construction.

I would even vote for a pin lock for TextSecure (if no lockscreen pin/pattern is set), because of two reasons:\n- people are lazy as hell and they are more likely to use a pin lock if they are asked less often (only for TS messages, not every time they use the phone)\n- people don't think about the question if their whole workflow is secure, but that installing one app is enough. They don't realize that the decision not to set a lock screen password a year ago will expose their \"secure\" messages even after installing TextSecure.\n\nI propose this kinda messy security model (in addition to the current one) because messy is exactly how humans treat security, either because they are lazy or because they don't fully understand how their decisions impact their security.\n",

That just sucks. Especially because of the issue which is described in the following article:\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html\n\nIn TextSecure however, all the users are seeing the same Emojis, which makes for a much better Emoji experience.\n\n> @jellium wrote in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/3445#issuecomment-121871752:\n> \n> And also it is not true that TextSecure makes sure that the Emojis seen on emitter and recipient phones are the same. Just tried with 2.22.2 version to my lady who didn't update: she sees the Google Emojis while I have the ugly Apple ones. \n\nThat is your fault. If you are using 2.22.2 at the moment, then you are on the beta release channel, since 2.22.2 has not yet been released to the stable release channel.\n\nYour \"lady\" probably is using the stable release channel though, which means she is still using 2.21.0, which means she has not yet been updated to the new Emojis.\n\nOnce she will update to 2.22.x, she will see the same Emojis that you are seeing.\n\nSo, it's not TextSecure's fault. It's yours (because you are using a beta version).\n\n> @jellium wrote in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/3662#issuecomment-121870421:\n> \n> Why on earth did you switch to Apple emojis?!\n\nWell, I can not speak for the TextSecure developers, but:\n\nIMHO the Google \"Noto Color Emoji\" Emoji set looks like shi*.\n\nLet's face it, most people (or at least a lot), do not like the Google \"Noto Color Emoji\" Emoji set.\n\nIf you don't believe me, then maybe you should read the comments in the following two issues on the AOSP issue tracker:\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=69755\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=73248\n\nAnd maybe you should also read the comments in the following XDA-Developers forum thread:\n\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2722892\n\nThe Apple Emoji set looks a heck of a lot better and is much more popular than the Google \"Noto Color Emoji\" Emoji set.\n\nThe Apple Emoji set is being used in Telegram, ICQ, WhatsApp and so on... (just to name a few examples)\n\nAnd even the Twitter \"Twemoji\" Emoji set and the Emoji One Emoji set clearly are modelled after the Apple Emoji set.\n\nSo, it's quite popular and therefore pretty much is the natural choice.\n\nAlso, Signal-iOS (the iOS counterpart to TextSecure) of course uses the Apple Emoji set, since all iOS devices are using it natively.\n\nSo, now that TextSecure for Android also uses the Apple Emoji set, the Emoji experience is much more consistent across both platforms, which lessens the risk of Emojis getting lost in translation as described in the following article:\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html\n\nRegards\n",

Could you please clarify?\n\nAnd one more thing, \"folks can always do the _scroll/_bulk process themselves\" assumes physically loading documents to the application and then reindexing them from that application back, did I get that right?\n\nI know it is recommended to delete first, but in order to not lose a single document we can't do that (there are plenty possible failure scenarios that would interrupt indexing documents back). The way our index is set up it is easy to find and delete old copies (that has been accounted for) - the new copies will belong to new parent and both have some identifying information, so it's easy to delete old copies by query.\n\nThanks again for taking time to respond!",

I've seen it discussed in contexts of other caches, but it was never requested for Guava's.\n\nNamespaces used to be asked for a lot back in memcached's heyday. Most of the time it was to invalidate a bunch of keys together which were inter-related. The solution was to use [generational caching](http://www.regexprn.com/2011/06/web-application-caching-strategies_05.html) (a version number as part of the key) and increment the generation when the data store was updated. That relied on the cache to lazily evict the old keys which wouldn't be used anymore.\n\nAlternatively you could build indexes and rely on locking since this is part of the same process. A `CacheWriter` could be useful to make insertion / eviction atomic with a separate multimap (namespace to keys).\n\nIf namespaces are to make regions to have sub and global thresholds, this is even messier. That's usually to share a cluster of memcached and perform resource accounting (e.g. Google's internal rewrite did this) or have an automatic cache sizing. The former makes no sense here, the latter is very messy in Java where GC masks sizes. Attempts to do it automatically (soft references, heap monitoring, etc) don't work well. Its better to be explicit and move large scale caching outside of the JVM (off-heap, memcached, etc).\n\nSo messy and confusing from my side of the fence.

The usage is\nvirtually the same as described in the design.\n\n> Another thing that is unclear from the design document is whether this is\n> ever expected to handle non-vendored third-party dependencies.

Obviously *can* be done (with varying degrees\n> of ease of use and reliability) but not clear whether there's plans to\n> actually do it.\n>\nWe have that problem in Bazel, I intend to\n\n   - If the dep has Bazel support already, try to upstream license usage. I\n   expect that will be cost on early adopters and the Bazel team until there\n   is more widespread adoption.\n   - If that is not feasible, or if the module does not have Bazel support,\n   we'll have to splice in the license attributions in the BUILD file. That is\n   slightly easier if there is no upstream BUILD file, because you will have\n   created your own. If it does, they will have to splice together. I don't\n   have a solution for that yet, but it is not that hard.\n\n\nWhat we have no plans for is automatic license classification based on\nreading the text and deciding what it means. There are projects that do\nthat, and perhaps someone could work that into repository rules. But that\nis definitively beyond rules_license's ambitions for the\nforeseeable future. Like the rest of the Bazel project, we are focused on\nprecise specification and repeatable mechanisms. Autoclassification can\nreturn results which are at some confidence level <100%, and worse, change\neach time the classification corpus changes. I'll let the experts in that\ndomain work on that problem.\n\n\n\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10687#issuecomment-901539333>,\n> or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAXHHHBTQZYLWMKA5G2BOJDT5RNEDANCNFSM4KN6OP5Q>\n> .\n> Triage notifications on the go with GitHub Mobile for iOS\n> <https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1477376905?ct=notification-email&mt=8&pt=524675>\n> or Android\n> <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android&utm_campaign=notification-email>\n> .\n>\n",

Instead, I think we'll need to update `EmbeddedDatabaseConnection` so that it returns `false` for an H2 database that doesn't have `mem` in its protocol.

The StackOverflow link says \"I wanted to change the direction the particles are being emitted.\" Basically how it currently works is a particle effect's PolarAcceleration (Angluar) will never account for the particles transform, meaning the particles will always travel same direction. It could be fixed by changing the Angular.activateParticles to account for the controller.transform when the particle is recreated. This would allow for a stream of water coming from a rotating hose (rotating the hose nozzle shouldn't translate particles that are already emitted)\n\nThis PR applies the transform for every single active particle (not  the direction of newly particles). But #3264 does mention changing displacement of the whole effect, so maybe it does apply. But either way:\n\nIf the goal is just to update the particle positions based on a change in transform it can be done something like [this](https://gist.github.com/Bolt-Head/694817b5e682d66d7ad63f27039ed32b). If used in the API it would probably be better to be worked into a DynamicsModifier.\n\nIt handles the delta translation (probably the most common use-case) and doesn't require a Vector3.mul(Matrix4) per point.\n\nIf Translation/Rotation/Scale was necessary the points could be translated by calculating the transform between the current and previous transform. This would require one left multiply per point while the PR has 2 (once in sorting and another in the renderers). Also it wouldn't require changing and maintaining every particle batch renderer.

Sorry for my delay in responding.\n\nSpring Security is not affected by the CVE listed since all calls to Nimbus are wrapped in a `try { } catch (Exception e) { }` block.\n\nSo, while it's technically feasible to update the Nimbus dependency from 6.0.2 to 7.9, we make it a practice to not do major version upgrades in patch releases. And since Spring Security isn't affected by this CVE, the best route is to maintain the upgrade policy and encourage developers to specify the `nimbus-jose-jwt` version themselves until they can upgrade to the latest Spring Security.\n\nActually, Nimbus is very quick with their releases, and so the code diff between 6.0.2 and 7.9 is quite small. I'd imagine that most applications would have no problem using the latest version of Nimbus.\n\nFor anyone who still feels strongly about the `5.1.x` line getting this security fix, we've found Nimbus to be very responsive to PRs. You might consider proposing a pull request to Nimbus that would fit in a maintenance release. It could be released as nimbus-jose-jwt:6.0.3, and then Spring Security 5.1.x could easily take the upgrade.",

This can even be seen easily: Increase the number of tasks to e.g. 1000000 and then call `Map.size()` on the result of `doWork` and you will see a value smaller than 1000000, for example in my case 999974 (might have to run it multiple times; might also depend on the number of CPU cores your computer has).\n\n> it reveals that Lock Striping performs better when using HashMap than ConcurrentHashMap\n\nYes, but what is the point of that? The whole point of this article is to show that `Striped` can be used as alternative to make access to a collection thread-safe, but why then guard access to a `ConcurrentHashMap` with `Striped`? `ConcurrentHashMap` is already thread-safe, so you would not guard access to it with `Striped` to make it _more thread-safe_!? It would be much more interesting to compare performance of the `Striped` version with using directly a `ConcurrentHashMap` (without `Striped`).\n\nAlso, for what it's worth the example code in https://www.baeldung.com/java-lock-stripping#4-concurrent-access-with-striped does not compile because the field is erroneously named `lock` instead of `stripedLock` (the code in this repository is correct though).",

We will make the deposit customizable when you create the offer, so traders can adjust it to the current market situation and their requirement for hedging against volatility. There will be a trade-off as a very high deposit protects better but u will find less traders who will take it. So the market will find the best values (hopefully).\nLuckily it does not happen too often but in times of high volatility I get disputes because of that. With BTC/fiat trades it was rare, just the last weeks with happened a few. With altcoins it happened when the altcoin was too volatile. \nI find it a pity also that traders abuse that current weakness and instead of supporting the platform use it to cheat the peer in such situations. But that's reality and we need to fix that of course.\nOn the other side u can see it positive as a hedge where the BTC buyer cannot lose more then the security deposit. As it is one-sided it will probably lead to a price bias in favor to the seller as he takes a higher risk. But that can open up interesting arbitrage with other exchanges :-)",
