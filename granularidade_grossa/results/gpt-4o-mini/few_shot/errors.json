Anar+ does this cool thing where it goes on with the show even if your mesh is broken or invalid. Java 3D is surprisingly exhaustive of a lot of core structures.\n\nI do work with systems integration quite a bit, and I can say that it sucks but sometimes your new system winds up usually being all of the other systems now just all together, and again like expressed before, is now its own system which is yet another thing to deal with. It could be nice to try to think future proof ideas like to be able to pivot around the n-th dimensions of a hyperplane or hypersurface, or if LLVM and other such compilation/translation/vm type stuff is the future for Java, how does one make sure that the solution is as pure of logic as possible so as to not tie itself further to machine or even environment specifics. \n\nI also like how the newer work by @codeanticode where the vectors are stored in the GPU. It would be cool to treat the GPU as your vertex database storage and accelerated manipulation engine. \n\nAnyway, all I have is inspiration and it came from you all, so I really am excited to see the kinds of things you guys all figure out.\n",
