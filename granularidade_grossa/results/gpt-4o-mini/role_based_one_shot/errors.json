For example, pgplot draws end caps, and it was created in 1983.\n> 3) No information is lost when end-caps are removed, but visual clarity is gained in all plots, and > especially in busy plots with many points and nearly overlapping error bars.\nIn sparse plots the end caps draw attention to the error bars, so I think visual clarity is lost by removing them.\nThere's a lot of \"I think\" and \"I like\", because ultimately this is an aesthetic choice.

All progress is about change, not about doing the same thing all over. Do you have an iPhone? Think about why they are so popular. Before we got them, nobody could imagine that phones and software could be that intuitive and playful. Now we cannot imagine how we could live with the clunky interfaces we had before. iPhones were different in a better way, and that's why they took over. I don't want to be dragged into an argument about commonness and the \"majority of users\", because it is not the point.\n> I would also be against removing caps as well because it isn't actually \"extra ink\". If you think about it, the lines are really the extra ink.\nThe command is called \"errorbar\". It draws error _bars_, you can hardly call that the \"extra ink\". If the lines are too thin, they can be made bigger. This is again not the point. I am also not against end caps in principle, as shown in the paper cited initially. The end caps alone (without a bar) are very useful to indicate a secondary uncertainty, typically a systematic uncertainty, in addition to a statistical uncertainty indicated by the error bar.\nThe default changes are a great chance for matplotlib to go forward. I offered my arguments, and I can continue to defend them, but I respect the decision of the higher-ups whatever they decide.
