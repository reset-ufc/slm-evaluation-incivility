Out of box your software is totally unusable, especially for kids\nThese AI, wtf is this? Why even cheap old chinese consoles with shitty hardware can just launch games and play without fucking with settings, but your software can not?\nYou have tons of shaders, but no shader preview. With paint.net u can preview changes, in your AAA software u cant. Very slow navigation, it does not remember position\nExtremely huge interface\nMy config is this\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61594968/85333850-4e563780-b4a8-11ea-97f7-b730b2c5f262.png)\nYour is this\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61594968/85333927-70e85080-b4a8-11ea-86c7-f9e45bac2f7f.png)\nWhy you describe wtf does 'audio' means? Can u make it fit in screen\nOzone has no scrollbar, no mouse support, if u try to scroll, actually its equal to up/down button\nPeople dont wait that software does not work with mouse\nU cant explain even default configuration, what button u need to press for some effect\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61594968/85334229-e0f6d680-b4a8-11ea-8ee7-44cdc1c33a8b.png)\nU can draw something like normal games if gamepad is not connected like 'L - ok', 'O - cancel'\nHow to reset settings with start button u dont descibe too\nWhy do u draw licence? It takes much space\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61594968/85334410-3501bb00-b4a9-11ea-962d-8b9ed949ca50.png)\nWhy not organize cores like\nNES\\\nSnes\\\nU just give people huge list of all cores. What difference between then - there is no description. But u can see that lisense is GPL v3, very important information haha\nYour software with 'release' has >13000 of files, size is bigger than 600mb and out of box it even does not have any core\nAlphabet keys are assigned on emulator functions. If u wanna make keyboard gamepad like\nwasd iokl it will conflikt, and no highlight. WTF, why F1 calls menu? Do u know that many people use laptop, they can assign something on F keys by default\nAnd they have to press Fn+F1 to call menu, who wait that?\nYour bloatwared AAAAAA software is extremely glitchy, unusable for NORMAL people\nEven your buttons numeration\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61594968/85335010-48615600-b4aa-11ea-83fc-caddb6418469.png)\nLike BY...some keys...AX is wtf\nOn 1st place u put very strange settings like bind timeout, duty cycle\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61594968/85335123-747cd700-b4aa-11ea-8d85-c3affaf220d2.png)\nIf user wanna change settings, on 1st place u need to have Port1, just tune control\nI dont know how after 10 years of development u still have so glitchy and unusable software",
