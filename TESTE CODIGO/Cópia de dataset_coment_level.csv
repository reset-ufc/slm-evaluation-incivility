Yes, I didn't have the time to work on this yet. I'm also not in the business of copying code unless it's up to my personal coding standards. So even with good inspiration like this, it will still take me some time.

This library is solid. It just does not implement all features."

Capistrano, the 2.0.x branch mainline is effectively on the verge of being deprecated, send a patch or things won't be fixed. And even if you do send a patch, changing the behaviour of core variable lookups is not something I approach lightly.

I agree with that. And still, lots of people do it. So for all software that I manage, I'll try and have it be compatible with everyday flawed humans, in hopes to lessen the risk and impact of errors in software based on mine, written by fallible humans.
BOfH would ship a GNU/Linux distro where the default shell acts fully like bash, just that on every line starting with an uppercase letter, the meaning of `&&` and `||` is swapped. Might even document it properly. You'd read the manual and probably wouldn't use it.

Just a few things about this issue thread:
1. Ratchet and Clank HD collection uses a similar smoothing filter for textures:
https://imgur.com/a/Kc52r
2. Squall, you're - like always - wrong, it can be used to filter textures - or any pixel based medium.
Whether or not xBR texture filtering looks better is subjective, so there's no point arguing either way. Adding this would be nice for those who like it, it could help scaling artifacts, and implementing a way to add xBR filtering could mean other texture filters could be added too, so people could have a variety and go with what they like."
108,30381958,44110244,Identity attacks/Name-Calling,"SonofUgly,
You're wrong for one key reason.
xBR and xBRZ are per pixel filters, they can only operate on the inside of sprite if the renderer operates AT the pixel level.
In the case of PS2 sprites, or textures, it will only filter the edges and no more."
109,30381958,44111074,Insulting,"What are you on about. Are you talking specifically about how GSdx currently handles textures, now? Your previous condescending remarks sounded like you didn't think xBRZ could be used on textures at all - which you do realize PPSSPP uses it, right?

The fact is that there is a huge amount of emulation scene fans that really enjoy XBRZ texture scalling... ...and the context ends here. With PPSSPP leading the way and lots of other emulators now following these steps (PS1, N64...) it's safe to say that everybody would turn to see if PCSX2 would follow on a such well recieved feature. It's not a leage of who likes it or not, making points etc, it's a polite-asking feature request and it's actually possible. Now it's up to somebody with the interest and skill to pick it up. If closed source plugins like Pete's OpenGL2 could be modified to achieve such effect then I bet PCSX2/GSDx can aswell. Let's just not argue if it's possible or not."

nearest neighbor. your mistaking the smooth look of xbr with an HD upscale. what it is, is a smoothed over approximation of nearest neighbor. i don't think any game studio would have intentionally made a game that looks like the xbr. it some how looks blockier and chunkier than nearest neighbor."

It literally does not matter what game studios would or would not have their games look like.
xBR is not perfect, but it is the closest we are going to get in real time to high resolution 2D assests (short of texture replacement, wich not all games will have; and it fills disc space, wich might not be ideal to some people, depending on the amout of games they own).
If you prefer nearest neighbor, nice, luckily that option is already available to you.
This is not a discussion of wich is better (wich is highly subjective); this is about having the option to use a feature that is already available in other emulators, that a number of people enjoy."

this seems to occur from time to time with a rather slow USB3.0 powered 4TB hdd (Touro Desk 3.0, HGST5K4000) in an external case during rsync & transferring of large files (several GiB)"
135,40463575,55506136,None,"clarification for above:
I had this happen with the above mentioned drive - of which I still don't know what causes it (but I suspect it could be related either to the chipset in the external harddrive enclosure where the drive sits in or powersaving features of the XHCI driver & hardware, which I already had issues with in the past)
another drive showed this behavior (a seagate ST3000DM001) which likely underwent a headcrash and did reallocate several sectors (<10). It had been placed in an external enclosure by fantec [db-f8u3e with an incompatible chipset against smartctl] that had shown in the past to have a life & mind of its own: it would occasionally turn off during transfers and causing trouble with other filesystems, on ZFS, however, the files so far seemed fine. The day before yesterday I placed the drive in another external enclosure and it worked well during backups (only transferring several hundreds of MiB of data per backup job incrementally via rsync) until I decided to run a scrub and check everything: after several hours the drive again screamed and made hearable noises of a head-crash and/or sector re-allocation (had those in the past) and access wasn't possible anymore to the drive
that's where the above posted message occured again
so at least in the second case (ST3000DM001) ZFS seemingly showed indirectly that something was wrong with the hardware/harddrive
so when encountering this message - make sure to double- or triple-check that it's not a hardware-issue instead a ""software""- (ZFS-related) problem"
136,40463575,55510374,None,@wankdanker I think that your issue is separate. It might have been caused by the zvol processing occuring inside an interrupt context. Pull request #2484 might resolve it.

139,40463575,56999855,None,"Had similar failures, which occurred during heavy rsync pulls from remote machine. I was able to make it happen very quickly by starting up the remote pull. Did this three times in a row and caused the fault every time. The symptom was that any userland zfs/zpool commands hang, but the machine was still responsive to other commands. I set the parameter spl_kmem_cache_slab_limit=0 (it had been spl_kmem_cache_slab_limit=16384), and the problem seems to be gone, or not easliy triggered.
Part of the process which triggers this includes snapshot renaming, **but no zvols** are involved in this process, although the pool has some.
The pool is a raidz1 pool, and there are no hardware issues on the server.

140,40463575,57042179,None,"@ColdCanuck Your comments regarding `spl_kmem_cache_slab_limit` piqued my interest in this issue which until now, I've not had time to follow. In fact, a quick skim of this whole issue makes me wonder how related each of the problem reports are and whether there's too much issue creep.
Back to the point at hand: I'm posting this followup because there have been a disturbing number of seemingly otherwise unrelated problems sporadically seemingly caused by using the Linux slab. Although I've not been able to spend the time on it I've wanted to, I've been rather knee deep investigating the series of issues related to Posix ACLs and SA xattrs and have seen at least one report (#2701) and, more interestingly #2725 which makes me think there may be a tie-in to our use of the Linux slab for <= 16KiB objects. I don't have any other brilliant observations offer at the moment other than to raise concern there may be problems realted to using the Linux slab and to ask @behlendorf, @ryao et al. what your thoughts are on this (particularly given the last few comments in #2725)."

Most of the time performance is fine."
164,40463575,273150765,None,"So, I replaced the drive which might have been causing issues, with a new Samsung 840 PRO SSD, partitioned 50GB OS, 4GB Swap and the rest available as L2ARC.
I've set the arc max size to 4GB on a system with only 8GB memory.
Tonight, the same issue occurred, rsync and then everything ground to a halt. So, it seems unlikely to be a disk issue. Nominal read speeds are 100MB/s+ so things are humming along quite nicely."
165,40463575,273153577,None,I can reproduce this issue fairly easily so just let me know what information you'd like me to collect and I'll try to do it.

You may be right.
I have 4x 4TB drives, and one 256 SSD as OS/Cache. 16GB memory, 2 core CPU (1.5Ghz Atom). This system is almost exclusively used for RSync backups. I do feel that this is pretty reasonable for my needs.
The ARC cache is 12GB, the OS has 4GB left over. The L2 cache, if enabled , is about 170GB.
I'll have to check how many files it is, but I'm not sure if it's multi-millions or not."
173,40463575,278011680,None,"@kpande you are right I forgot to give any relevant infos about my underlying hardware. Sorry about that, here are hopefully all the relevant infos:
My server is a virtualization Server running Xen 4.4 with currently 6 virtual machines which all have their logical volumes (LVM) stored on a RAIDZ1 volume with 3x 2TB Seagate SATA enterprise disks (ST32000645NS). The Debian 8 OS is independent and located on two internal SATA-SSD disks of both 16 GB in RAID1 using Linux MD for mirroring. The CPU is an Intel E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40GHz with 6 cores/12 threads. Out of these 6 cores 4 vCPUs have been pinned to the host/hypervisor/dom0 using the `dom0_max_vcpus=4 dom0_vcpus_pin` Linux kernel options. The server has 64 GB of TruDDR4 ECC memory and out of this 64 GB of memory 6 GB has been reserved to the host/hypervisor/dom0 using the respective Linux kernel options `dom0_mem=6G,max:6G`. Finally I have reserved 2 GB RAM of these 6 GB for the ARC using the following `zfs_arc_max=2147483648` zfs module option. I have also disabled ZFS prefetch if that is of any relevance (`zfs_prefetch_disable=1`).
Below is the output of an actual ARC summary (server has bee rebooted 5 days ago):

it was mv process from one zfs to another in the same pool (actually it behaves as cp, not faster). the process hangs forever (at least few hours) and not allow to terminate with a signal. zpool reports errors-free. Now I've started `zpool scrub`, let's see what it will report.

When engineers use labels such as ""boy""/""girl"" in ways that reinforce toxic gender stereotypes, such engineers show their ignorance and (perhaps unconscious, perhaps latent) misogyny. So, stop. Think about how you use your language. And be considerate.
Another related example: the widespread use of repulsive ""master""/""slave"" labels in software systems.

190,40896758,356786100,None,"I solved this problem by using `:inverse_of` on the association in both models.
```
class Belonging < ActiveRecord::Base
belongs_to :having, inverse_of: :belonging
end
```
```
class Having < ActiveRecord::Base
has_one :belonging, inverse_of: :having

```
And then @Manifold0 I used an after-create callback on the factory for the model without the foreign key, so they look like this:
```
factory :belonging do
having
end
```
```
factory :having do
after(:create) do |having, evaluator|
having.belonging || create(:belonging, having: having)
end
end
```
In the callback, `inverse_of` allows for the associated Belonging to be returned from memory even if it isn't saved yet, as is the case when you `create :belonging`. You can do some dynamic checking, while not relying on something like `Belonging.first`.
@Kriechi this will help your test performance by not creating extra throwaway records, and also affect your actual production performance by making fewer trips to the db. Which is the actual purpose of `inverse_of`."

Probably a wrong example here but is it possible to do it inside (sometimes an object belongs to an object that belongs to an object, and if we were to manually create each object from the top and reference the next one outside of the factorybot file then it would be a mess everywhere), something like this:
```
# this is wrong but you get the idea
FactoryBot.define do
factory :bear do
# Run this first so everytime a bear gets created, a term for this bear gets created first to be used later
before(:create) { create(:term }

after(:build) do |bear|
bear.period.term ||= bear.term

I use `after(:build)` instead of `after(:create)` and AR methods instead of passing ids around, so this setup will work for both build(:bear) and create(:bear). The associations follow the build strategy (build/create) of the parent, so if you create they'll assign first and then automatically populate all the ids on save.
You can force build strategies if you want to, but I don't recommend it as you can easily end up with some funky saved/not-saved ""associated"" records. But there's a bit on that here: https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md#associations"

comfortable with the Python language is a prerequisite to using

unfamiliarity with Python (and a characteristic of most programming

point of view is that they have a lump of data and they want it inside

solves, go see pandas if you have CSV, scikit-image if you have images,

Well, take it easy!!!
I don't know whether you are one of scikit-learn staff or not, but I need
to say that your way of talking is harming both scikit-learn staff and
users (us), due to the two reasons:
First reason, criticizing people (like what you did) and assuming that they
are novice in Python so they don't know how to work with scikit-learn,
means you or the staff are trying to blind their eyes to the truth that
scikit-learn staff are not able to create a clear tutorial to allow loading
the real data, at least. In addition, pretending that the tutorial of
scikit-learn is perfect in spite all the questions regarding loading the
real data (not the toy data as it is too easy to be imported comparing to
the real data) is something needs to be reconsidered, and this means that
scikit-learn staff don't care about the name of scikit-learn at all.
Second, we can understand from your unsuitable way of talking that you
already forgot that scikit-learn is a product, and we as users are
customers, so either you or the staff of scikit-learn should respect all of
us and thank us for any comment or bug fixing. This is the professional way
of behavior. So I recommend you to think of your words before saying them. If
you are knowing the way of loading the real data and you'd like to help,
don't only say go see pandas, better you answer people's question nicely
rather than hurting them with your words, but if you're simply not able to
do that, so keep quite.
On the other hand, regarding the question ""should we instead add as a
section in the tutorial here?"", I would like to say ""_YES_"", you or
scikit-learn staff should add a section in the official tutorial about how
to load your own data either CSV, or ARFF or text or whatever, as users are
interested to load their own data, this is very critical issue should be
considered in the tutorial (not to be ignored). *If you rely on the user,
then what is your work? *
Nevertheless, for those who are still struggling with scikit-learn, I would
like to say, this is not the end of the world, and as I mentioned
previously, find another to tool make your life much easier. For this
reason, and in order to save your time, I would like to recommend some
tools to assist you in data mining procedures. For instance, Waikato
Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA),
http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/, last version is WEKA 3-7-13, is a
collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. WEKA
allows you to use its schemes either from GUI or writing Java code, so its
very easy for non-programmers. Additional to WEKA, R is also an excellent
tool for data mining stuff, you can also perform tasks of R from WEKA or
vice versa. However, if you have a patience to design a prediction process
manually (drag/drop), RapidMiner is a great tool for this propose where you
can design a very nice flow to achieve your target.
Thanks David van Leeuwen for your support.
Good luck in your analysis.
Cheers,
Martin

229,47049745,160201906,None,"Hey Martin,
Kindly don't be offended.
He did not criticize :) He, being one of the top contributors to scikit-learn has to make tough decisions as to what will go into our codebase and what will not, as a more verbose documentation or tutorial might not be preferable for a lot of people. Gael has in fact contributed a lot of user guides himself to scikit learn to help users.
The reason why he was opposing that addition to the tutorial was that there are multitude of ways in which users have their data stored and such a user guide on how to get the input data from all of them (a text file/csv file/database/zipped archive), is indeed out of scope for scikit learn, which is a machine learning library.
The most important thing to note here is that **it is very clearly explained by documentations of libraries which handle data, like numpy or pandas.**
It is expected from the user that he or she knows this! Since it seems to not be very clear, he suggests that we add a FAQ, pointing the user to such userguides, which are more elaborate than we could possibly get :)
It may appear that our tutorial could be a bit more elaborate on how the inputs are obtained. But the thing, in general, with userguides is that, it could _always_ be a little bit more elaborate, which makes us set a hard limit on how detailed our userguides can get, to help contain the userguide in a maintainable format :) If you think from that perspective, you yourself would understand our situation.
As this issue is open someone will indeed send a PR soon adding a nice FAQ entry and an example, maybe, which could help clarify your (or any other new user's) doubts on input formats.
Cheers!"
230,47049745,160203689,None,"Hello @MartinLion ,
we understand your eagerness to solve your problem, and your frustration when it is not solved.
However, you seem quite misinformed about what is scikit-learn, how it works, and how the project is developed. Therefore, I would like to make some points clear for you. As you can see from
http://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html, scikit-learn is a community effort that is developed by a team of volunteers, mostly on their free time. Gaël is one of the creators of the project and its current leader:
scikit-learn would certainly not be the same without his contribution (the same for other volunteers), and he certainly did not deserve your dismissive words.
What I would like to emphasize is that there is no such thing as a scikit-learn ""product"", or scikit-learn ""staff"" (only a handful of people have worked full time on the project). You mention ""we as users are
customers"", but how much are you paying for using scikit-learn? Despite the important development cost, users get scikit-learn for free (and of course that's how it's intended to be). In fact, the development of the project relies on a fragile alchemy: users' needs being a top priority for developers, and users reporting bugs and concerns in the most positive way. The kind of ""ranting"" that you wrote can be very discouraging for developers, who contribute their free time and their expertise just because they believe that scikit-learn is a useful tool for the community. Some prominent developers stopped contributing to open-source software precisely because of such ""customer-like attitude"" of a few people underlining only shortcomings, and dismissing the huge development efforts. Please try to see the bright side as well: you received advice and comments from a lot of people, I'm sure that there was something for you to learn out of it, even if it did not solve your problem. Also, although users' needs are indeed a top priority of scikit-learn (it has an amazing documentation, of which most scientific Python packages can be jealous!), each software addresses a well-targeted niche of users, and it is just normal that scikit-learn cannot fit all users. For example, it is preferable to use scikit-learn with already a good knowledge of Scientific Python. So, I'm really glad that you found a
package that suited your needs better, but please also acknowledge the time and good will that people gave away when answering you.
So, folks, let's all show some good will and keep a constructive dialog.
That's how the project we love will keep on rocking!"

Maybe we should make clear that scikit-learn is a Python **library**. It does not have the same scope as WEKA or RapidMiner. It fits perfectly into the [scientific Python ecosystem](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/) but you should be willing to write code if you want to use it."

I do my scientific work in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) since a couple of years, and before that, in R, octave, c++/c (some 30 years in total). The Julia ecosystem is quite dynamic, and it is all very exciting, but Python just has this very large ecosystem and very clean coding, which makes it very attractive to use for little side experiments. This time I had to do some topic classification of (single sentence) text documents. Now there is an abundant choice of language technology tools in Python, and I believe that via [lda](https://pythonhosted.org/lda/index.html) I got to scikit-learn. Great tutorials, lovely datasets and all, but I found it very difficult to find out how to organize my own data so that I could load this in. Just now, I browsed through the user guide again to find the docs for ""load_files"", but I could't find an entry. So a google search for ""sklearn.datasets.load_files"" got me there just now, and I happened to remember the particular module path from more painstaking searches yesterday (it is mentioned somewhere in a tutorial). For me, the essential information would have been: ""Organize your data one document per file, one directory per class""---more or less what's under the documentation for [load_files](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_files.html). This all makes perfect sense, but I come from a community where usual formats are ""one datapoint per line"", often with the class label on that line. But having said all this, I am pretty impressed how the Python (text) community has standardized data representation, from what I've seen so far. But perhaps because of the widely used standard data representation, this aspect has naturally less attention in documentation. As a final note, whenever I try to teach students how to use some scientific tool set or another, I have to spend quite some time on ""how to import your data"". Nobody likes to do it, it can be a lot of effort for what you potentially use only once, and is therefore always a difficult threshold."
233,47049745,160270773,None,"@davidavdav I agree that loading data is a difficult and important thing. However, it is a domain-specific problem. You have a particular type of data. I have another. My data is medical images of brain activity. I can tell you how I organize my data and load them. I can even tell you that we have written a whole package about this, with its own documentation. But that will probably not help you.
What you want is something that tells you how to organize and load _your_ data. Now, it may be that your data is something fairly classic, that many people have; for instance tabular data most often stored in CSV files. In which case there is a need for a package doing this data loading. I don't believe that it should be in scikit-learn. It needs to be in a package that is specialized for this data. For instance, we are not going to put image processing in scikit-learn. For tabular data, the dedicated package is pandas; as I mentioned in my reply we need to point to it. We, the scikit-learn team, want to make plugin pandas into scikit-learn easier. But it is not as easy as it may seem and it takes time (one of our core devs is prototyping something).
I realize rereading your post that your data is most likely text documents. So my two examples of data (medical images and tabular data) were both wrong :$. Maybe the documentation on processing text with scikit-learn could indeed be improved and touch a bit on data organization. I don't know, I very seldom process text. But if you want to do add a few words on this, you are most welcomed to do a pull request. Anyhow, this illustrate my point about the diversity of the data: this whole thread is mostly about loading CSV files, as can be seen from earlier comments (before the thread exploded into a rant). The important thing is not the ""CSV"", which is the container, but the data model that underlies a CSV file. This data model is that of columns of data with different nature. It's a very different data model than processing text documents.
And finally, you are unhappy that teaching people ""how to import your data"" is time consuming. I don't think that there is an easy fix for this, even in a specific domain. The reason being that data meaning (ie data semantics) is still very much an open area. It's intrinsically hard to describe what the data means and how it's organized. You can try a simple experience: grab a dataset from someone you don't know, about an experiment you don't know, and try understanding it. Not even loading it, just understanding it. I am sure that it will take time. What takes a human time tends to be very difficult for a computer."

237,47049745,257356922,None,"Well you could add some information about common errors that happen when loading own data. For example I have bumped on `Unknown label type: 'continuous-multioutput'` and not a hint, anywhere, what that could mean. I've tried passing:
- a numpy array created from csv reader
- a numpy array created from pandas
- regular array parsed line by line
- pandas dataframe
- a numpy array created from csv reader converted to regular array
- etc...
I'd recommend adding section summarizing assumptions about data, for example it was sheer luck that I found information that data sets may not contain NaN's Nulls etc. Also, what should be the parameters of a numpy array and how should pandas dataframe look like."
238,47049745,257483426,None,"Perhaps that error message could be clearer, but I think passing regression targets to a classifier (as in your #7801) is a usage error nothing to do with loading your own dataset."

I would suspect (and maybe @mitchellh could elaborate more) a few things:
1. Ruby is slow and somehow throttling the subprocess
2. Wget is faster than curl (which is what Vagrant is using)
3. Vagrant is also allocating time to unpack the box
4. Wget is allowing for some type of compressed download
It would be helpful if you could benchmark this with curl for reference."

It's a possible option but security is also important. For me official vagrant boxes from folks like puppetlabs hosted on Atlas are so slow to download at times that I wish this issue could be resolved. For internal vagrant boxes that I build for my company we have the option to host on S3 or Artifactory or private Atlas org.
@mitchellh - yes - curl is just as slow (for me). I don't think it is a Vagrant issue - but a backed server hosting issue. Granted - not a Vagrant issue per se."

Yes, this is because curl can only use one of my 3 connections at the same time. No, that's not the connection's rated speed. The rated speed is 45mbps. Yes, bittorrent does perform better. Just sayin-- your rationale for not supporting bittorrent is kinda thin here."

Any ISP, in any state I've traveled to in the last couple years.
This problem is squarely on whatever Hashicorp is doing for hosting, and that's where it needs to be fixed. If they're unable or unwilling to fix it, a torrent solution would certainly help without taking their resources aside from development for adding a torrent client to the tool.

324,57258770,346974011,None,"@panozzaj's comment above doesn't quite work if a `Vagrantfile` expects a specific version of a box (that command will add a box without a version). Instead, you can do the below.
# Steps to get a specific box at a specific version without using `vagrant` to perform the download
I'm using laravel/homestead in this example because it's what I was trying to get.
1. Download the box using a better download client (e.g. your browser, curl, wget, whatever).
2. Create a new json file (anywhere), add this to it (note, tweak the `name`, `version` and `url` keys to match the box you want, don't worry about the `checksum` key yet. For `url`, use the path to the file you just downloaded, example below):
```
{
""name"": ""laravel/homestead"",
""description"": ""Whatever you want"",
""versions"": [{
""version"": ""4.0.0"",
""providers"": [{
""name"": ""virtualbox"",
""url"": ""file://c:/users/madmatt/Downloads/47dce273-9892-4691-a746-c4f351ae44a5"",
""checksum_type"": ""sha1"",
""checksum"": ""abc123""
}]
}]
}
```
3. In your `Vagrantfile`, add the following lines `vm.box` and `vm.box_url` keys):
```
Vagrant.configure(""2"") do |config|
config.vm.box = ""laravel/homestead""
config.vm.box_url = ""file://c:/users/madmatt/path/to/the/json-file-you-created-in-step-2.json""
end
```
4. Run `vagrant up` as normal.
5. `vagrant` will complain that the sha hash doesn't match (`The checksum of the downloaded box did not match...`). Take the string that appears next to 'Expected', copy and paste that into the `checksum` key of the json file you created in step 2.
6. Run `vagrant up` again, this time it should load from the local file, store it as the correct name and version, and successfully run it.
Hopefully someone finds these steps useful... funnily enough I have done all this research (having never used vagrant before), have tested it a bunch of times, and the original `vagrant box add laravel/homestead` command that I started running 3 hours ago is still only 8% complete, even though in that time I've downloaded the box file 8 times outside of vagrant.
The rest of this is just my experience, no need to read further ;)
# My experience (aka. why is vagrant so slow to download boxes)
Was getting 420b/sec (yes, that's bytes per second) on a gigabit connection downloading https://vagrantcloud.com/laravel/boxes/homestead/versions/4.0.0/providers/virtualbox.box.
I downloaded the same file via browser, curl and wget with speeds varying between 12 and 27MB/sec. I then tried doing both at the same time - I was able to download via Chrome, Firefox, curl and wget before ```vagrant box add laravel/homestead``` had downloaded 1%.
The URL I got in the browser was ```https://vagrantcloud-files-production.s3.amazonaws.com/archivist/boxes/47dce273-9892-4691-a746-c4f351ae44a5?X-Amz-Algorithm=<snip>&X-Amz-Credential=<snip>&X-Amz-Date=<snip>&X-Amz-Expires=<snip>&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=<snip>&X-Amz-Signature=<snip>```
I don't know what the problem here is, but I can think of a couple:
* Whatever UA vagrant uses is bad, and AWS severely limits it
* Whatever vagrant uses to download isn't following redirects, or somehow never ends up downloading from AWS infrastructure, instead using some other terribly overloaded server/proxy"

Root cause: Slow speed of `ubuntu.com` cloud box servers
Solution: Switch to another trusted source for Ubuntu boxes, Puppet Labs.
I've been using `ubuntu/xenial64` for developing apps that must deploy to Ubuntu 16. (Heroku) And download speeds have become ridiculously slow, or failed entirely. I used wget and watched it follow the redirects and saw that it's actually hitting `ubuntu.com`. I tried several ways to download from Ubuntu, but they all resulted in speeds around 50 KB/s. So I went back to the Vagrant box listing to see who else might have a Xenial 64 box, and if I'd trust them. Turns out Puppet does, and I trust them as much as (or even more than) Ubuntu. My `Vagrantfile` now has the config line:
```
config.vm.box = ""puppetlabs/ubuntu-16.04-64-nocm""

* Configuration is 1/10 the size and complexity of Vagrant for my typical Rails app
* Build and Boot times are much faster
* On my Linux desktop in particular, there is a 10x speed increase vs. running on Mac.
* There's a huge reduction in RAM required. * I'm going to save a ton of money on development computers. I.e., 8GB RAM is plenty for a Docker-based dev machine. (Not so good for Vagrant+VirtualBox though.) And a top-tier i7 isn't necessary anymore either to get good speeds.

353,57258770,383594627,None,"Hi everyone,
This issue overall is very complicated in that it is not easily reproducible and is very dependent on location, network health, and the actual download location of the target box. In many cases the box being downloaded is located on a third party system. One feature that was introduced in Vagrant a couple releases ago was the notification of redirect to show when boxes are being downloaded from a third party server.
There have also been claims that the embedded curl is downloading files slower than the system curl. I have not been successful in validating this claim and do not see a difference in download speed between my system curl and the embedded curl. However, as of Vagrant 2.0.4, the [`VAGRANT_PREFER_SYSTEM_BINS`](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/other/environmental-variables.html#vagrant_prefer_system_bin) environment variable is available for all platforms. When enabled, Vagrant will use local system binaries if available instead of the embedded binaries. If you observe faster download speeds with your local curl binary, this provides a switch to easily enable Vagrant to use the local binary.
My apologies for the frustration this issue has caused. It is something I have investigated multiple times, but the number of variables involved makes this extremely difficult to get a valid reproduction. I have updated Vagrant's functionality to make the underlying cause more easily understandable where available (redirect notifications) or easier to work around. I am continuing to investigate our options for box downloads from Vagrant Cloud in different regions of the world (which have occasionally presented with issues). However, with box downloads from third party locations, there is little I am able to do to control their available bandwidth or any kind of throttling they may impose.
Cheers!"

I tried adding:
```
dummy: Elem,

The idea here is that the compiler needs to know what constraints it can put on the type parameter `Elem`, and usage of the [`PhantomData`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/struct.PhantomData.html) type will instruct the compiler how it can do so.
You can check out the [examples](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/struct.PhantomData.html#examples) for `PhantomData` to see some usage, and in this case you'll probably want to do something along the lines of:
1. Refactor the struct so unused type parameters aren't needed. This can often be done with associated types, something along the lines of:
``` rust
trait A { type B; }
struct C<T: A> {
inner: A::B,
}
```
2. Use `PhantomData<Elem>` to indicate that the compiler should just consider the type parameter used, considering `Foo<A, B>` as containing something of type `A` as well as `B`.
You probably don't want to store `dummy: Elem` as it will require you to store an extra element and could have other memory implications as well."

Z

358,60472468,342592975,None,"Hi, I had a similar problem regarding to unused type parameter.
Here is the simplified code, I need to control the visibility for quicksort's sort function. ```rust
struct Quicksort<T>; // <---- unused parameter warning

fn join(...);
fn split(...);

}
```
Any help to resolve the problem? because struct Quicksort does not have any fields. The type parameter is solely for the sort function from trait.
Otherwise if I removed `impl<T> Quicksort<T>`, then I don't need the T for Quicksort at all."
359,60472468,399987553,None,"For those who will look here for answers:
""In most cases you do not need additional type parameters at all"".
That's it. Just remove them.
Taking @Piping example for illustration.
Let's get rid of type parameter for `Quicksort`.
```rust
struct Quicksort;
```
Now `rustc` obviously won't complain about unused parameters since there are none.
But at some point we actually need that type-parameter.
Continuing. Type parameter can be introduced at function level.
```rust
impl Quicksort {
pub fn sort<T>(&self,ar<T>){
Sorter::sort(self, ar<T>) ;
}
}
```
Now when it comes to implementing a trait things goes smoothly again since type parameter is already exists in `Sorter` trait.
```rust
impl<T> Sorter<T> for Quicksort {
fn join(...) {...}
fn split(...) {...}
}
```
There are few places where you actually need artificial type parameter.
1. When type conceptually contains some generic type.
2. Type must implement a trait with associated type.
```rust
trait Trait {
type X;
}
```
Now either the type in question will be able to implement the `Trait` with some predefined `X`.
```rust
struct Foo;
impl Trait for Foo {
type X = u32;
}
```
Or it has to have this artificial type parameter after all.
```rust
struct Foo<T>(PhantomData<T>);
impl<T> Trait for Foo<T> {
type X = T;
}
```"
360,60472468,609420134,None,"@neithernut In case you're still interested, I had a similar problem and I solved it by creating an additional variant that stores the `PhantomData` and a never type `Empty`:
```rust
pub enum Empty {}
pub enum Foo<A, B> {
X(A),
// ...
Void(Empty, PhantomData<B>),
}
```
[playground example](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=c297fb0f024a70630ce2ffa1e6810b3e)
The good news is that it's zero-cost and does not pollute the variants you do use.
The bad news is that, until [never type exhaustive matching](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/08/13/never-patterns-exhaustive-matching-and-uninhabited-types-oh-my/) comes to Rust, this approach will pollute the code when you match on your enum (although you could macro your way around it):
```rust
match foo {
Foo::A(_) => (),
// ...
Foo::Void(empty, _) => match empty {},
// ^
// phantom data
}
```"
361,60472468,723657165,None,@alexcrichton I also had some issues with this and generic enums. It would be very useful if the compiler could recognize that the type parameter is only used in a trait bound for another type parameter. I don't understand the reason why this would not work now.. Can't the compiler derive the constraints from the trait the type parameter is passed to?
362,60472468,731195418,None,"@mankinskin I agree. PhantomData in this instance just pollutes the code. It is an implementation detail that should never be exposed in a public API (which is what happens with both @AdrienChampion 's and @neithernut 's code. It's also exceedingly irritiating, adding code complexity, complicating construction (so making it harder to just pass generic enum members as closures w/o writing extra code, etc. It's a code smell in Rust itself."
363,60472468,732503909,None,"Looking back to @alexcrichton's response and the RFC, I think the question is not so much why unused type parameters cause an error, but why the compiler considers type parameters unused in examples like the OP's.
To me, it seems like `Elem` has one usage (in `List: AsSlice<Elem>`), albeit not in the body of the struct. It seems like that should constitute a usage for the purpose of variance inference, since it implies a variance bound: `Elem` must be invariant since `AsSlice`'s parameter is invariant.
In Scala for example, the equivalent would be `class Foo[E, S <: Seq[E]](val seq: S)`. Scala doesn't infer variance, but it ""knows"" that `E` must be covariant or invariant. If we try to make it contravariant (with `-E`), we get `error: contravariant type E occurs in covariant position`.
If getting the compiler to recognize these variance bounds would be complicated, perhaps lifetime and non-lifetime parameters could be handled differently? As the RFC notes, only lifetimes have subtype relationships, so it seems like non-lifetime parameters might as well be ""inherently"" invariant, and not subject to inference. Code like `struct Thing<'a, 'b: 'a>(&'b u32);` would continue to be rejected, but I don't think there's any ""legitimate"" reason to write lifetime parameters like that."
364,60472468,782851250,None,"I think perhaps we should reopen this one. The associated RFC doesn't seem to justify a compiler error in code like:

{
foo: F,

368,60472468,785757920,Insulting,"@mankinskin I agree completely, and I feel your frustration; I share it, and it's got worse as rust has become more widely used.

I agree that there eventually needs to be an RFC for this but I don't really see the point of restricting discussions about feature changes in these github issues. I suppose they use this as a bug tracker, and new features are not supposed to be tracked here.
In general, I think there are a lot of improvements that could be made to the entire open source workflow nowadays. The tools don't really integrate well, basically just using hyperlinks. For open source work there ought to be issue dependencies, resource budgets, integrated documentations and tests, voting on forks, funding, user permissions, all of that.

I believe that we, as a community should invest more in solid base systems. I admire Linux distros like Slackware that have a rich package repo with very few dependencies. I think we should try harder to get our 'bases right' instead of trying to fix fundamental problems with tooling.
Also, I hate the fact, I can't just grab a lib from the web anymore because some of them seem to be tied pretty closely to the whole composer workflow, they have no standalone tarballs, they need autoloader this and that... But I have to admit I am very conservative and stubborn in some matters. There's lots of other issues as well, composer uses git/github as repositories, interfering with my use of it as a version control system (preferred layouts) etc etc..

As a security engineer who works primarily in PHP and contributes to open source cryptography libraries for the PHP community, I [strongly disagree and say that using Composer is a ***damn good* idea**](https://paragonie.com/blog/2017/12/2018-guide-building-secure-php-software#dependency-management).
> Updating bad code in zillions of libs will not magically improve the reliability and security of your code.
Uh, yes, it will!
Outdated third-party libraries with known (i.e. not zero-day) vulnerabilities are one of the most reliable RCE vectors when testing a system. (Aside: Thank you, projects that ship their own PHPMailer bundles, for all the easy footholds into otherwise challenging networks to penetrate.)
This isn't intuitive for most people, so I've laid out [the case for automatic security updates](https://paragonie.com/blog/2016/10/guide-automatic-security-updates-for-php-developers#why-automatic-updates) before.
Composer makes it easier for projects to keep dependencies up-to-date. This creates a measurable improvement to the security and stability of real world systems."
457,81567058,419816184,Bitter frustration,"Updates often introduce new bugs and new vulnerabilities. So your just replacing old bugs with new bugs. Only right after an update 'you consider your software safe', but as time progresses it turns out the initial update was not safe at all but by then most developers pretend the software 'is now suddenly unsafe because it is old' - that's not true, it was already compromised right after the update. Besides that, dependency management systems make it worse, because you don't even know what you install anymore. There may be even some toxic packages among the dependencies:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15272394
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11340510
https://sensorstechforum.com/arch-linux-aur-repository-found-contain-malware/
While I don't pretend that bug-free software can be written, a better solution might be to focus on simplicity. Dependency management systems compromise simplicity because they make it easy to solve the natural issues regarding dependencies. In a sense, they hide complexity - and paradoxically therefore they increase the risk of importing new bugs and vulnerabilities.
So, I reverted the commit that removed the Composer file because, even though I am against it, I also don't really care, I just get a bit angry when Composer related problems (like what version string to use) creep into the RedBeanPHP repository. And yes, you make screenshots all you want and laugh about RedBeanPHP or me. I don't give a shit. Have fun.

How are redbean releases more secure than another PHP library? They aren't. You aren't signing your releases and there's no verification system in place. The fact is humans make up the ""PHP community"" and it's up to us to verify security. And as far as human verification goes I'll trust the millions of users of a given popular package on packigist versus having to manually check the Git of a project like yours. Honestly though just looking at your source tree your ORM is straight out of PHP 4.x times. Your project has a custom unit testing schema because apparently PHPUnit isn't secure enough? You have no `spl_autoload_register` anywhere in your code even though it makes sense here to use it. You're still publishing redbean on packigist with a composer.json. So I guess ""trust me"" but no one else is enough for you. Like honestly wtf even is [this](https://github.com/gabordemooij/redbean/blob/master/p533patch.php)? You can't even generate code coverage reports because of your home baked unit testing system which I'm sure doesn't support clover.xml output for code coverage. Which is why you don't have a code coverage badge.
Yea yea packigist needs signed releases to give it some ""security"" but honestly the fact is the market has moved on.
In most PHP shops these days it's about speed & quantity of code / features over ""security"" concerns.
Why would I implement AWS myself when they give me a library to use? Why would I implement the Fitbit API manually when [someone already wrote one](https://github.com/djchen/oauth2-fitbit)? Especially when it comes with unit tests and lots of users who will call stuff out if it breaks or is compromised.
We're all idiots? Really dude? The company I work for and all the jobs under it could literally not exist without the good work put in by hundreds of developers I've never met. Because it's literally impossible for me to sit down and write an API implementation for every service we interact with. And yet we are currently running a company based on tying all these things together into a coherent service.
I think you seriously need to re-evaluate your philosophy and take a look at a lot of the [good](https://thephpleague.com/) work being done currently in the PHP space by dedicated people.
And finally. If you care sooooo much about security maybe it's time to upgrade to PHP 7.1 because security support for 5.6.x ends in 3 months."
459,81567058,419863669,Vulgarity,"> Updates often introduce new bugs and new vulnerabilities. So your just replacing old bugs with new bugs. Updates also fix bugs and old vulnerabilities. Using a dependency manager lets you lock down to a specific version of a library. I can fork a library, perform changes, tag it, point my `composer.json` to it. I don't have to do anything manually. If I want to know which *version* I use, I don't have to dig through files.
I could literally go through every single word you wrote and try to argue with you but it's pointless. You suffer from NIH syndrome, your practices are bad and as you wrote - you don't give a shit.
You are spreading dangerous blatant lies in order to justify something you wish were true. That's the problem. The second problem, which is your personal problem, is your attitude. I know there's absolutely no way we can have a discussion, your opinion is set and I can tell you'll do anything to defend your POV. Yes, this is your project, you are entitled to opinion but in your world 1 + 1 yield 75, not 2. Ego is a dangerous thing. I won't insult you, there's no merit to that, we should be civilized after all. I'll just kindly ask you, just ASSUME you might be wrong. Just for abstract thinking's sake. I really believe there's no malicious intent behind what you wrote, but could there be a possibility you don't have all the information at hand to make statements such as ""dependencies suck"" or ""dependencies in libraries suck""?

This is seriously your answer? You demonstrate a lack of understanding of what actually makes a package manager have ""secure"" releases. A secure release is signed with a private key that only you would have. At the moment anyone can get into your Github user and commit anything they want to your project. Sure you can revert it once you get your account back but until then damage can be done.
Your hashes mean nothing. Anyone can edit your website and edit those hashes anytime they want. None of what you mentioned gives increased security.
I also have a 10+ year old ORM with hundreds of projects and more then a decade of maturity. But you know what? Nobody cares.
If you have no code coverage report your tests mean nothing.

Oh, I can commiserate with you on this point all day long. They're frustrating, especially when you're the person who causes them and you're puzzled about how to fix them.
I don't have a horse in either the ""Does Gabor use Composer?"" or ""Does RedBean use Composer?"" races. I do care about making PHP more secure at the ecosystem level, and that obligates me to seek out and fight against misconceptions about software security.
To be clear:
* Automatic updates *may* introduce new bugs, but they'll fix **the bugs script kiddies are actively exploiting**. Simplicity isn't a panacea here, but it is helpful. (I write my code to be easily audited by third parties, and the incidence of bugs is much lower as a result.)

As shown above, this isn't enough for .lnk files. Windows hides the .lnk extension. If you usually use smaller thumbnails, the minuscule difference in the icon is barely visible.
Also, it is arguably because torrent clients aren't smart that these types of malicious torrents are still going around, and that's why I think qBittorrent should provide this feature.
IMHO certain extensions should also be skipped by default, for the same reason. It would be a great security and usability improvement.

If you are downloading torrents with malicious .lnk files, you need a solution for a more urgent problem: don't download such torrents, use better sites/sources, or pay more attention. After all, it is the user's responsibility to not fall for phishing emails as well. Inspect URLs/files you click.

""Malicious users are taking advantage of distracted/careless users"" would be a more accurate statement. Do you think the possibility of receiving phishing emails is a flaw of E-mail? If so, is the possibility of hearing the voice of a scammer in real life, believing what they say, and giving them money, a flaw of your ears? Should your auditory system should autoblock certain words/sentences on its own? Perhaps it should be the brain acting on the information instead.
Furthermore, the greater issue of downloading these kinds of torrents should not be underestimated. You have to go out of your way, even when searching for illegal content, to find these kinds of torrents. And no, the `.exe` in RARBG torrents does not count as an example of this practice in a popular site; it is actually just a harmless text file with the `.exe` extension designed to prevent mirroring by software that, ironically, relies on ""file extensions"" to make assumptions about their content.
Not to mention that if anyone actually accidentally clicks a dangerous exe, it should be caught by UAC anyway. If the user has disabled UAC or blindly clicks through it, then they either know what their doing or they ""know enough to be dangerous"", in which case whatever happens is their own fault and there's nothing we can really do."

First of all, it is indeed a shame that the Windows default is wrong, and that the way to change it requires some knowledge to do so. But that is a Windows problem. One can post an issue on the relevant forum/issue tracker about that, not here.
Secondly, regardless of such setting, I'm not really keen on catering to this kind of ignorance/stupidity of ""I'm carelessly clicking on stuff and ignoring warnings and expecting it to work"". If someone doesn't care to learn how to properly use a saw, should their complaints to the manufacturer be taken seriously when they cut themselves?

You don't need to click through anything.

There are always exceptions to the rule. I am sure there are some examples of software bypassing UAC, or just being dangerous enough without needing to do so in the first place. But this is a secondary point anyway.

This is one hell of a strawman fallacy, but ok. Not to mention that you seem to be advocating in favor of antivirus/anti-spyware. In a sane computing environment, a black-box proprietary software made by a for-profit corporation running with administrative privileges (aka """"""antivirus"""""") is not considered a layer of security. The true solutions for the problems these programs claim to solve lie somewhere else in the stack - don't use Windows, use Free (as in Freedom) software, package managers with cryptographic signing, etc...

These kinds of claims are worthless if not substantiated with data. You can't just claim something and ask others to disprove it. Start by defining what is ""too common"". 30% of torrents? 40%? 50%? In which sites? The burden of proof lies with you. You're welcome to open a new issue investigating this, with some pretty graphs.

Again, ridiculous strawman. Browsers need sandboxing for any kind of user due to the unfortunate way the Web has evolved. In fact, mainstream browsers don't even come secure enough out of the box IMO.

I treat security as seriously as anyone else who really understands it. In reality, you'd be surprised how little of it _you_ actually understand, to be able to make the arguments you make and then accuse others of not treating security seriously.

505,102234932,102234932,None,"### Expected Behavior
All directories created by `npm install` should have the npm config setting `umask` applied to their file mode/permissions. The `umask` setting is [clearly described as](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#umask) the ""value to use when setting the file creation mode on files and folders.""
### Observed Behavior
During `npm install`, if directories are created by the `tar` module as a side-effect of extracting a file, the umask setting is ignored. For example, when tar extracts `foo/bar/baz.js`, it creates the `foo` and `foo/bar` directories (if they don't exist) before writing `baz.js`. These directories do not respect the umask setting.
Instead, npm's umask setting is ignored and [`process.umask()` is used](https://github.com/npm/fstream/blob/master/lib/writer.js#L15). However, there is a further bug/unexpected behavior where the `tar` module will actually [do the equivalent of `chmod a+x`](https://github.com/npm/fstream/blob/master/lib/writer.js#L352) on directories created as a side-effects of file extraction, meaning the even `process.umask()` isn't strictly observed.

The umask setting in npm is being completely ignored for a seemingly arbitrary subset of operations during `npm install`. This is almost certainly not the intended behavior. It also explicitly disagrees with the behavior described in the documentation, and is inconsistent even within the observed behavior of npm (sometimes it respects umask, other times it doesn't, for no good reason).
The underlying cause (cited in the issue) is that the tar module isn't aware of npm's `umask` setting, and just does its own thing (using the `process.umask()` value, then overriding the execute bit on it.)

I argue that end caps are not useful as visual cues for most plots. They are seriously harmful in ""busy"" plots with many data points, where error bars start to overlap and the end caps start to cross other error bars.
Tufte teaches us that we should maximize the data-to-ink ratio. End caps do not provide any additional information over the error bar, so they should not be there by default. End caps are useful to indicate a secondary interval, like the systematic uncertainty of a point, a beautiful example is Fig. 13 in this paper:
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.4809v3.pdf
I recently introduced a patch to make the default length of these end caps part of the configuration, so that they can be turned off by default (by setting errorbar.capsize to 0 in matplotlibrc). Please make this the new default. :)"

""What's common"" is a great design principle. It's also known as the principle of least surprise. I suspect most people will be surprised if they try to plot an error bar and don't get end caps by default

The current matplotlib style of drawing error bars mimics a style that pre-dates matplotlib by many years. For example, pgplot draws end caps, and it was created in 1983.
> 3) No information is lost when end-caps are removed, but visual clarity is gained in all plots, and > especially in busy plots with many points and nearly overlapping error bars.
In sparse plots the end caps draw attention to the error bars, so I think visual clarity is lost by removing them.

The principle of least surprise is a good one, I agree, and the change I am requesting is not very surprising.
On the other hand, ""What's common"" is a terrible design principle. All progress is about change, not about doing the same thing all over. Do you have an iPhone? Think about why they are so popular. Before we got them, nobody could imagine that phones and software could be that intuitive and playful. Now we cannot imagine how we could live with the clunky interfaces we had before. iPhones were different in a better way, and that's why they took over. I don't want to be dragged into an argument about commonness and the ""majority of users"", because it is not the point.
> I would also be against removing caps as well because it isn't actually ""extra ink"". If you think about it, the lines are really the extra ink.
The command is called ""errorbar"". It draws error _bars_, you can hardly call that the ""extra ink"". If the lines are too thin, they can be made bigger. This is again not the point. I am also not against end caps in principle, as shown in the paper cited initially. The end caps alone (without a bar) are very useful to indicate a secondary uncertainty, typically a systematic uncertainty, in addition to a statistical uncertainty indicated by the error bar.
The default changes are a great chance for matplotlib to go forward. I offered my arguments, and I can continue to defend them, but I respect the decision of the higher-ups whatever they decide. As a friend and promoter of matplotlib, I am just trying to contribute in a positive way."

The vertical lines are arguable only visual clutter however they are a guide to the eye to find the actual errors.
Obviously I can just change the settings (after finally finding out these things are called caps).

@HDembinski The data-ink ratio is actually an argument against this choice. The cap contains the complete information, namely how big the uncertainty is. The error line itself contains no information whatsoever. It is solely a guide to the eye, to find the end more easily. What I really want to use this answer for, is to strongly emphasis that the defaults should not focus on making nice looking plots but unambiguous ones. Aesthetics is to a certain point always up to the beholder, and he is encouraged to change the design in a way he finds pleasing. However, wrong information should never be conveyed. That is why it was so important to change the default color map. This belongs to me in the same category.
The plot I showed was exactly such an example (and it is a real-life example). I tried different algorithms and suddenly my plot showed me that algorithm 1 is orders of magnitude better, as there was no more visible error in comparison to plot 2. You can now say, just change the design how you like it. But that just makes it even more dangerous for me, as I might forget about the terrible choice matplotlib does. I go to a different machine and might do the same error again and might lose a workday if I am not careful.

This is what I consider harmful default behavior, as the default plot gives me wrong information.
Of course, I can change the configuration. But this only increases the problem, I do some quick analysis on a different machine and forgot that I have to change the behavior. The result: I draw wrong conclusions and lose in the best case some hours till I realize my error. It is basically the same issue matplotlib previously had with the color map defaulting to jet."

It is the case that this behavior can be controlled both by an rcparam (for global control) and via a kwarg (for per-call control). It is also the case that we are not going to change the defaults.

In fact you never even mention `select` anywhere in this thread. When you fail to provide the single piece of information that would allow people to reproduce the issue is it any wonder that the issue would be closed?

Good afternoon,
When hydrating an Embeddable with nullable attributes the result is an instance of the Embeddable class , this is obviously correct and expected behavior. If all the attributes are null the hydrator will still return an instance of the class with all of its properties null , even if I persist and flush my Entity with the Embeddable being set as null . For clarification :
```
class MyEntity
{
protected $myEmbeddable;
public function setMyEmbeddable(MyEmbeddable $myEmbeddable = null)
{
$this->myEmbeddable = $myEmbeddable;
}
[...]
}
$newEntity = new MyEntity();
$newEntity->setMyEmbeddable(null);
$em->persist($newEntity);
$em->flsuh($newEntity);
```
Calling $newEntity->getMyEmbeddable() will return an instance of the MyEmbeddable object with all of it's attributes set to null .
I expected $newEntity->getMyEmbeddable() to be NULL . Can someone clarify is this is expected behaviour ? In case it is , how can I achieve what I'm looking for ? Best regards"

642,120671163,245548631,None,OK.

Do you mean lifecycle callbacks — maybe `postLoad` — as shown in http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/events.html#lifecycle-callbacks? Looks like those only work on entities, not value objects, as far as I can see? Eg. if I used `postLoad` an embeddable will already have been hydrated with invalid data (if the data in the database is all `null`, for example). Alternatively, if I move the VO properties onto the entity directly I’ve lost the nice encapsulation that embeddable so usefully provides (eg. if I had a `Product` entity with a `SalePrice` with 2 properties, `value` and `currency` I’d have to move those 2 properties onto the entity. Whilst I could then have those properties be private and do an `is_null` check for those 2 properties before instantiating and returning the VO from `getSalePrice() : SalePrice { … }` it does rather compromise my entity.
I’m almost certainly missing something here, sorry. Rather new to Doctrine so still learning!"

OK, gotcha.
So in the example I gave — a `Product` entity which wants to use a `SalePrice` VO with 2 fields, `amount` and `currency` — would you suggest simply putting a `sale_price_amount` and `sale_price_currency` property on the `Product` entity, make those private, and then have `Product::getSalePrice() : SalePrice` first check whether the 2 properties are `null` before attempting to instantiate and return the VO?
If so, that seems workable and means the entity is responsible for checking if the VO should be instantiated (rather than having the VO able to be ‘invalid’ and have to implement an `isValid()` method).
Example code of what I mean:
``` php
class Product
{
private $sale_price_amount;
private $sale_price_currency;
public getSalePrice() : SalePrice
{
if (
is_null($this->sale_price_currency) || is_null($this->sale_price_amount)
) {
return null;
}
return new SalePrice(
$this->sale_price_currency, $this->sale_price_amount
);
}
}
```
Is that something like what you’re suggesting instead of nullable embeddables?"

Correct.
Basically, since this is a scenario that Doctrine can't cover right now (because of how RDBMS DDL works), you can just implement it in userland for the few times where it pops up."

I suppose the major downside of your approach is that you do still have a VO in an inconsistent state, whereas if you don't let Doctrine hydrate the VO as an embeddable you avoid this; a bit more boilerplate & checking code, but you never have a VO in an invalid state.

My 2 cents on the sensitive subject of nullable embedded properties:
- when the Embeddable has at least one non-nullable `@Column`, and this field is null in the database, **there should be no ambiguity** and **`null` should be assigned to the embedded property**. Otherwise (currently!) you get an empty, invalid value object that has non-nullable properties set to `null`. IMHO, the current implementation is broken here.
- when all `@Column` in the Embeddable are nullable, there should be a boolean setting in the `@Embedded` annotation that controls whether or not you want an empty value object or a `null` value when all fields are `null` in the database. **Your choice**.
Finally, you only have a real problem when you have a fully nullable embeddable, **and** want to make the distinction between a `null` property and an empty object. People have suggested to add an extra column in the table, which would work, but would add a ton of complexity for what I think is an edge case. To clarify, **I think this edge case should not be supported by Doctrine**.
The previous two bullet points, however, **I would strongly suggest working on them ASAP**. I'll be happy to help, provided that lead developers are happy with the concept."

As for the pull request you mentioned, (please keep in mind that I'm not an ORM guy) it looks like it's a fairly large pull request that touches transaction logic in the DBAL, affecting most of what it (and thus ORM) does.

That said, there is currently a development push going for 3.0, so maybe there's an opportunity to get those pull requests merged.
Open source projects need contributors to move forward and evolve, especially when maintainers have little or in some cases no time for the project. However, writing pull requests is just a small part of that work - most of it is looking at issues, figuring out what's going on, evaluating pull requests and making sure your user base is not going to burn you at the stake because you messed up.

Some settings on your machine make Composer unable to work properly.
Make sure that you fix the issues listed below and run this script again:
The json extension is missing.
Install it or recompile php without --disable-json
The phar extension is missing.
Install it or recompile php without --disable-phar
The filter extension is missing.
Install it or recompile php without --disable-filter
The hash extension is missing.
Install it or recompile php without --disable-hash
The openssl extension is missing, which means that secure HTTPS transfers are impossible.
If possible you should enable it or recompile php with --with-openssl
```
To solve the openssl extension missing problem; i've installed openssl 1.0.1q and link ssl/bin/openssl to usr/bin/openssl; meanwhile openssl is in my usr/local/src/php-5.6.13/ext.
The other missing i enabled them via the ./configure command option with, --enable-filter, --enable-hash, --enable-json, --enable-phar. To be precise you will find the configuration

684,128495560,174525942,None,"Hi,
Thanks for asking this question. Nokogiri uses XML parsing libraries under the hood (libxml2 for MRI, xerces/nekohtml for JRuby) and so we have very little control over how those libraries decide to ""fix"" broken markup."
685,128495560,174865819,Bitter frustration,"Are you kidding me ? Your code does not work on a few different servers with different operating systems and you telling me ""We don't care, the library is to blame"". The ""less than"" sign is a common case, which can occur in any text."
686,128495560,175007699,None,"The ""less than"" sign by itself is not valid HTML or XML markup. There's no spec on how to fix broken markup.
So yes, I'm saying that the underlying libraries, written in C or Java, which are responsible for tokenizing and parsing the documents passed into Nokogiri, and most especially for choosing how to ""fix"" that invalid markup, are beyond the control of Nokogiri.
Lastly, I just want to ask that you keep your tone constructive. I'll point you at our Code of Conduct that's in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. It's easy to misinterpret your previous comment as entitled, rude, and judgmental. As a result I've locked this issue down to ensure nobody else will respond to you in kind.
I'm sorry we weren't able to help you in this instance, good luck on future endeavors."
687,128495560,175008924,None,"Final thought, explaining the behavior, is that ""one < two"" is interpreted by both parsers as the string ""one "" followed by an incomplete tag ""<two"".
If you want ""one < two"" to be treated as ""one &lt; two"" (that is, a text string) then I'd recommend escaping it first. Perhaps the Rails team, based on the context of `simple_format`, can selectively apply escaping? You'll have to take it up with them."

689,163697977,231320091,None,I am facing the same issue. Does anybody have an idea how to solve it?
690,163697977,231713864,Impatience,"@arielelkin I agree that Nokogiri should ""just work"", and in fact it generally DOES just work on Linux and Windows. OSX is the outlier, and it's because of the combinatorial explosions of configuration options, along with the fact that Apple has decided to deliver xcode (and xcode update) configurations that are hostile to developers maintaining non-trivial C extensions.
I'm not sure what outcome you're hoping to achieve with an approach like the above -- rude, disrespectful, entitled -- but watch and hopefully learn as I treat you with more respect than you've treated Nokogiri maintainers.
We believe at this point that the installation tutorial:
```
http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html
```
works for nearly all known configurations of OSX. Did you go through the tutorial and follow all the steps for OSX? If so, that would be useful information to note when opening a support request. If not, help me understand how we can better point people like you at that tutorial? In particular, the xcode bit is really required for Mac users at this point.
If the tutorial doesn't address the problem you're having, then please make sure you provide both the output from `gem install` and also the `mkmf.log` file.
I'll further note that above, you've tried to install three different versions of Nokogiri. I'll also point out that you've got permissions errors even when you sudo, which makes me think you've either got a really weirdly configured system, or else you're trolling.
---
I'd like to note that the Nokogiri Code of Conduct
```
https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
```
asks everyone to be nice and reminds you that Nokogiri maintainers are volunteers, who don't get paid to work on it, and have personal lives and families. Your approach in this issue is offensive and rude, and in all honesty represents most of what I dislike about being an open source maintainer. You expect something for nothing, and heap abuse on volunteers who have spent hundreds of thankless hours working to get Nokogiri to work on OSX.
If you've surmounted your personal communication and anger-management challenges and read this far, I'll ask that if you go through the installation tutorial and it doesn't address the problem you're having, that you open a new issue and respectfully provide enough information to help a maintainer diagnose the issue on your particular system.
I'll be locking this issue both because your request violates the CoC, but also just to preserve Yet Another Disrespectful Request for posterity, and so that when I finally get fed up and ragequit open source, I'll have plenty of interesting Github Issues to point people at.
Finally -- everyone in the Ruby community who saw this issue come in and didn't do anything to police it -- you're part of the problem, too. For every open-source maintainer who quits, y'all wring your hands and are full of regret; but these are the opportunities you miss to prevent that from happening. A community that doesn't police rudeness and disrepect is not a community I'm happy to be a part of.

@SUzB - sorry you got caught in the crossfire on this, but you've also made a very unconstructive post wherein the OP claims a problem and shows three very different logs for three different versions of Nokogiri, and you say, ""I am facing the same issue."" No, no you're not.
Please feel free to open a new issue providing enough information for us to diagnose your issue. At the very least, info about your OS, and if you're OSX then we'll need to know more about xcode and will need to see your logs."

> that it would also be cool to send a reminder email after some days
i am clearly against a delay. the email should be sent instantly, not with some days delay. if there is a security hole, the admins want to be notified (instantly). i assume that updates are only shown to the admin user, so keep in mind, that you require me to work as admin with my sync app to get such important informations.

> i assume that updates are only shown to the admin user, so keep in mind, that you require me to work as admin with my sync app to get such important informations.
You are assuming wrong. In the admin section you can actually select which groups get update notifications. By default it's admin only, yes. But if you don't sync with the admin user (like I do), you can also change it to any other group."

Maybe it's only a small number of users, but for those users, it is a moderately serious security issue, as there is no obvious way to get notified promptly about upgrades. Currently, I typically find out about security updates weeks or sometimes even months after they are released, when I just happen to log in to the web interface."

706,209725628,420439268,None,"A perspective that may not have been considered just yet: For the past year I've been wondering what's wrong with my instance that it's not sending me an email when new versions are released. It only occurred to me as I was typing up a question on the forum that I may have misunderstood the function, and to read the notification option carefully and search for it (which brought me here). Others may be letting their instance go unupdated not realising that there's numerous updates available.
The reason I haven't seen the notifications is because I rarely use the web app, like others here. The sync is done on my server, and I access the synced directory over the network."
707,209725628,438934152,None,This would also be useful for update notifications of apps. Sure I also have the sync client and see notifications there. But the workflow of a sysadmin for these kind of things are usually via email notifications.

710,209725628,506326217,None,"> This would also be useful for update notifications of apps.
I want to emphasize this statement, because it seems to be much more important to me. I am currently managing more than 20 Nextcloud instances which I am not using by my own. So I rarely login there. I actually do follow the Nextcloud releases stream, so I know when its time to update my instances. Some of them are even managed instances and therefor updated by another company. But for all of these instances there are different apps active, for some instances there are even other users enabling/disabling apps. So I would need to follow all these release channels and then know which apps are active in which instances. Then login manually to the concerned instances and press the update button. And thats even the case for the managed instances because normally app updates are not included in the management. That is more than inconvenient and its feeling very much unprofessional. A Mail notification with a direct link would help here, because then only the concerned instances would notify. An autoupdater for apps **as an option** (and activity notification) would make this even more handy for a lot of environments."
711,209725628,555143985,None,"I've just seen this and I have to agree, email notification would be really useful."
712,209725628,555180821,None,Since the addition of `occ update:check` you can run a cronjob to alert you by email when there are updates available or use the ouput in a proper monitoring system.

723,230340780,230340780,None,"I needed a global install of NVM because I have some node based cron jobs and a few legacy applications that are rather picky about which version of node they are able to work on. For a time I worked around this by sourcing the nvm script everywhere but that seems to be a somewhat unmaintainable solution. The requirements I have:
- NVM should just work in non-interactive sessions
- Every user should be able to select a installed version of node (or use ```$ nvm exec```)
- Some users should be able to install newer versions of node
This is the solution I came up with: (shout out to @icecoldphp, for the initial version)
0. I've done this on a debian 8 machine, as the root user
1. Create a group called ""nvm"", ```# groupadd nvm```
2. Add root to the nvm group ```# usermod -aG nvm root```
3. Goto the ```/opt``` directory and create a directory called nvm - Make sure the groupd owner is nvm ```# chown :nvm ./nvm```
- Set the permissions so that the group is allowed to write in there and all file will inherit the group ```# chmod g+ws ./nvm```
4. Follow the [git install](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#git-install) steps using ```/opt/nvm``` as the directory - To make sure the group can also write aliases, cache downloads and install global packages make sure the directories exist and have the correct permissions:
```
# mkdir /opt/nvm/.cache
# mkdir /opt/nvm/versions
# mkdir /opt/nvm/alias # chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/.cache
# chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/versions
# chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/alias
```
5. Using the following snippet create ```/etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```:
```#/etc/profile.d/nvm.sh
#!/bin/bash
export NVM_DIR=""/opt/nvm""
[ -s ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"" ] && . ""$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh""
```
6. Ensure that the script is executable ```# chmod +x /etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```
7. If you want to use nvm in non-interactive sessions as well make sure to source the nvm file in ```/etc/bash.bashrc``` before the line saying ```# If not running interactively, don't do anything``` by adding ```. /etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```.
8. For bash completion (which is inherently interactive ;) add ```[ -s ""$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"" ] && \. ""$NVM_DIR/bash_completion""``` after the section about bash completion.
Every user can select a version of node (as the permissions for public are ```r-x```) and users in the nvm group can install and remove versions of node (permissions for the group are ```rwx```).
My questions are:
- As a developer I know next to nothing about linux, could this be improved, is it bad style, etc? Any feedback is welcome.
- Should this be documented in the NVM README.md?"
724,230340780,303203372,None,"nvm is not intended to be global or system-wide - it's per-user, per-shell-session.
Thus, each user account must have its own `$NVM_DIR`. They can certainly share an `nvm.sh`, but I'd recommend they all have their own one of those too.
I would not want to document anything in the readme that encourages people to use nvm across user accounts - there's other tools for that."

727,230340780,304429494,None,Yes it is always good to go with what nvm is intended for. per user. Go for per user installation. I have a similar kind of a situation (I used to install node without nvm previously) and did the same.

You know, for an util that should eliminate version discrepancies and staff it sure does increase it a lot... I mean I have server that deploys web projects on git pushes via hooks (i.e user = git). But sometimes I need to log in and redeploy the same things manually by invoking the git hooks manually (user = me). And sometimes my colleagues have to do the same (user = foo)... And then there is a process manager (PM2) that should be central for everyone, but it relies on node as well...
And everybody have it's own node&npm. Except root, so trying to sudo yields even less results, i.e ``node: command not found``. Ok, your util is the wrong one for these kind of things, but NPM in it's [official docs explicitely says to use nvm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) to avoid permission problems that unavoidably accompany multiuser usage."
729,230340780,357039868,None,"Yes - the hazard is ""multiuser usage"". In your use case, everyone should be running `node` as the same user."

Yes, it *is* a project maintainer's hubris to dismiss people's use cases as invalid. Heck, I do it all the time. Just cause something is free doesn't excuse you from doing things people don't like. So it's free? I'm not allowed to complain about a vital feature being missing? I guess that makes me hostile. But remember for everyone 1 of me who bothered to write something here there's 99 others that find this page, get super annoyed, and move on with their day deciding on one solution or another.
People want to use node, nvm, and npm **system-wide** in a **global** context. This isn't rocket science. Why do people have to install it manually for every user on a system?
Like would it really kill you make a link in /usr/sbin and check the user that ran the command?
Congrats your tool is now an instrumental part of NodeJS development. It's time to level up and make it a system-wide command."
733,230340780,410942171,Bitter frustration,"@hparadiz I would prefer people with that desire and use case to use a different tool, since that's not what nvm is designed for. Just because you want to cut down a tree doesn't mean a pocket knife is the right tool for the job."
734,230340780,424688046,Bitter frustration,"Hey guys,
A bit of heresy from me over here that relates to this thread.
(but let's not launch the Spanish Inquisition (tm) just yet)
We needed properly managed and stable node version on our bespoke in-team-dev machines as well as on some specific live use-cases, and for that have forged an Ansible role to do just that. You may call it a hack, or you may not, it's your free will, but we're using NVM as the drop in replacement for the distro's `node` package, accessible globally. NVM turned out to be heavens apart in terms of stability than any `apt + n` combination we tried. I appreciate the tool (kudos and big thanks to you @ljharb) so it's the solution we incorporated.
For anyone interested (hope you don't mind sharing here bro):

For anyone else, please use the proper user-scoped approach. Whatever floats your servers chaps."
735,230340780,424837006,Bitter frustration,"This problem exists when running node via cron as well since cron doesn't source any bash scripts and therefore won't see node installed via nvm. The solution for now tends to be to source the nvm bootstrap before every cron command:
`* * * * * source .nvmrc; node /my/script.js`
See: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/67940/cron-ignores-variables-defined-in-bashrc-and-bash-profile
The _real_ solution is still to install node globally but what do I know? I'm just a silly user."
736,230340780,424849636,Bitter frustration,"@hparadiz there's no need for the passive-aggressive comments. If you want to install node globally, go for it - but nvm isn't the right tool for that job."
737,230340780,424862720,Bitter frustration,"@hparadiz , cron is notorious for that. Be it node or not. You would want to put in full paths to whatever binary you get to use inside a cron.
Thanks to your question, I just realized cron doesn't even see /usr/local/bin, so will update my role to use the most common of paths: `/usr/bin/node`, and if you did similarly yourself then you could use the absolute path to your gulps etc, like:
`/var/lib/nvm/versions/node/v8.11.3/bin/gulp`
and the hack would be completed, I think."
738,230340780,424877194,Bitter frustration,"Your assertion that nvm is the wrong tool for the job is a slap in the face of the paradigm created by BSD systems for the past three decades. If I install a binary on a machine it's expected that the binary is available to the entire system. Not just a single user. If I install ffmpeg on a machine I expect that I can run ffmpeg from my terminal but also from any running process. Expecting a process to source a bash script for every binary is madness. If everyone followed your paradigm the *nix eco system would be way worse off.
Here's [documentation](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/dirstructure.html) on BSD directory structure. Here's a [pretty good discussion](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/11544/what-is-the-difference-between-opt-and-usr-local) on where user level packages should be installed. Sadly nvm follows none of these well documented installation paradigms. If you did we wouldn't be having this discussion.
Furthermore if there are actually two users on a machine that need to use nvm you are duplicating binaries on-disk for each user for absolutely no reason. You could easily store them globally and link them to the user's home directory should you choose to continue to use your existing directory structure. My nvm folder on my Macbook Pro is already 479M with only two versions of node. If I told every developer to install node via nvm for every user I'd be looking at gigabytes of files on-disk for absolutely no reason. I tend to like efficiency and this is not it.
The only reason people use nvm is because node's release schedule is very rapid and apt, yum, brew, and other built in system package managers choose to not update fast enough. For this reason you have people using nvm even though they need node installed globally on a machine.
Which brings me to my next point: node is a run-time binary for running Javascript code. A run-time _should_ be installed globally. This is how literally every single run-time works.
By default when someone claims to have a piece of software that is a ""version manager"" I would expect it to do that on my system, not just within my bash terminal.
You might as well change the description of this project to:
> Node Version Manager - Simple bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions (for the current terminal user in bash compatible shells only).
You have multiple people in this thread asking for this and you claim that nvm isn't designed for this. Which is odd since nvm is obviously downloading node to a directory on the user's machine and managing directory links and aliases for them. Having it be global is a tiny additional feature on top of what you already have. You could simply soft link the directory where node is installed to /usr/local/ and be good to go (if root).
Finally for security reasons Linux [explicitly supports users](https://www.tecmint.com/add-users-in-linux/) (section 6) without a home directory. A common one in Ubuntu is `www-data` for web servers. In this thread you are explicitly saying you won't support this completely valid use case.
I'm not trying to be mean or passive aggressive. What you're sensing is disappointment."
739,230340780,424915534,Bitter frustration,"@grzegorznowak
Yes, cron is notorious but that's only because most people have no idea that the cron running environment is completely different from their terminal bash environment.
Make it tell you what's going on:

```
$ tail -f ~/crontest.log v8.4.0

You actually do *not* want full paths to the binaries in your crontab. Use [`env`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/env).
You can actually make your JS files themselves executable!
```bash
printf '#!/usr/bin/env node\nconsole.log(process);' > myscript.js
chmod +x myscript.js
./myscript.js
```

That nvm may not follow some conventions is irrelevant; they're *conventions*, not requirements.
I don't agree that a runtime should be installed globally, nor that it is. Many binaries are installed per-user.
That multiple people are asking for (free labor) doesn't mean they're entitled to it; I continue to claim that if you want this feature, YOU SHOULD NOT USE NVM FOR IT. That you're unhappy with that isn't really my concern.

This is actually something someone might put up a PR for, here's the summary: add some logic to [the bit in `deps.js` that calculates the version spec to use](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/latest/lib/install/deps.js#L273-L280) to default to the specific prefix used by that version, _if there was one_.

756,232455334,306490497,None,"@zkat Why does `npm update` default to `--save` at all?
I don't really see the point, since I don't need to change my semver ranges except for breaking changes (e.g. `^1.0.0` => `^2.0.0`) and shouldn't those be manual anyways? 😕 I find the commands in `yarn` to make a lot more sense in comparison:
- `yarn upgrade` will upgrade each package to the latest version specified by `package.json`, without modifing `package.json`
- `yarn upgrade package` will upgrade `package` to `latest`, and save the new version with the default range in `package.json`
- `yarn upgrade package@^2.0.0` will upgrade `package` according to the given semver range, and if needed save the new range in `package.json`
### Example of npm breaking my ranges
I have a package `a` that depends on package `b`.
`b` has three published versions: `1.0.0`, `1.0.1` and `1.1.0`.
For some reason, I do not want to use `b@1.1.0`, so I set my dependencies to `""b"": ""~1.0.0""`
I run `npm update`, thinking that I will get `b@1.0.1`, which I do. But npm will change my dependencies to `""b"": ""^1.0.1`.
The next time I run `npm update`, I will get `b@1.1.0`, which is *not* in the original range!
---
It feels like I will have to use `npm update --no-save` all the time, and also instruct everyone on my team to do the same. 😕 Or is there a better solution?"
757,232455334,306572698,Bitter frustration,"@Maistho If you want to stick with `~`, I recommend you set it in your _project_ config with `echo 'save-prefix=""~""' >> npmrc` (in your project dir). That'll set that to default.
As for everything else? Well, that's the result of setting `--save` as the default across the CLI. This is the behavior as it's always been if you'd set `--save`.
`update` is a command we've been intending to overhaul, and we know it's something where the warts start getting more obvious as soon as you start saving. I wish we'd had time to actually redesign it by the time npm5 came out, but we really just didn't have the bandwidth for it, and it seemed better to just get something out there asap and then do a proper redesign. The same goes for `npm outdated`, which is right now tied up directly with update.
The stuff you're saying is super useful and sounds like a really good direction to take the command in. It's good to hear about the different expectations people have of this so we can make sure to write the thing people want this to be.
If you care enough for it, it'd be great to get a more complete RFC filed that describes the `update` that you wish we had and that outlines your needs from it. If that sounds like too much, just hang tight -- we'll be getting to it soon. 👍 Thanks y'all for your commentary, and for your understanding!"
758,232455334,306811307,None,"@zkat Thanks for the detailed response :smile: Setting the save-prefix will instead change all `^` prefixes into `~`, which will just replace my problem with a different one (since I want to mix caret and tilde ranges).
I'd the more than happy to write an RFC concerning `update`, but I'm not sure how I would go about it. Do you have any example/guide on how it should be structured?"
759,232455334,311071479,None,"Landed here after noticing npm changing my package.json in ways similar to the above. In my case, `npm update some_module` changed the package declaration from `some_module: ^0.1.6` to `some_module: 0.1.8` (dropping the caret specifier). As it turns out this was because I'd added `save-prefix=` to `~/.npmrc`.
This behavior feels pretty broken to me. I added the caret to this particular module as a way of saying, ""take minor updates"". In removing it, NPM effectively reversed that decision, which is categorically wrong.
I believe the problem here is that the`save-prefix` option is given precedence over what is in `package.json`. Instead, `save-prefix` should only apply when installing a new module. For existing modules, the range specifier should not be altered.
Also, given that `package-lock.json` is now a thing, I can see a case for saying `npm update` shouldn't touch `package.json` at all. (But I'm still trying to understand how package.json and package-lock.json interact, so not gonna get on a soap box about that.)"

775,235832393,235832393,None,"Hi,
Leaflet is a very useful component but I'm facing currently a behavior which seems very weird and I could not find a workaround for it.
I'm using Leaflet 1.0.3.
I'm using Chrome Version 58.0.3029.110 (64-bit). The same happens on mobile devices my app is ported to (android/iOS).
I'm running Windows 10 Pro 64 bit
1. I'm adding a marker to the map and I want to affect its ordering by zIndex means:
`var marker = new L.Marker(location,
{
icon: new L.Icon(
{
iconUrl: iconUrl,
iconSize: [size.width, size.height],
iconAnchor: [anchor.leftOffset, anchor.topOffset]
}),
draggable: draggable,
clickable: true,
zIndexOffset: zIndexOffset
});`
In my example I'm using zIndexOffset of 202.
2. After adding the marker to the map (marker.addTo(map)) immediately I see that the marker object changes and get a zIndex of 619. Actually each application run with the same initial zIndexOffset I get a different zIndex on marker object after adding it to the map.
3. I have an event listener on 'mousedown' event and when I inspect the marker object received by the listener zIndex is again different (477). Meaning it has changed even from the arbitrary value set in setp 2.
4. In case I zoom in and out the map the zIndex will change again.
All of this doesn't allow me to set different markers on top of others since step 2 change ruins any logic I may use in my code.
Here's the example of what happens in the [leaflet playground](http://playground-leaflet.rhcloud.com/gexa/edit?html,console,output):
How could this be fixed or maybe any workaround?
Thanks in advance"
776,235832393,308393252,None,"This is not a bug, this is behaviour as expected.
You have to keep in mind that the option name is zIndex**Offset**, and **not** `zIndex`. The `zIndex` of each marker depends on the *vertical coordinate of the marker*. Look at this screenshot from https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.Icon.Glyph:
![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/09ba35cbec1a15aaf2a599be333a85d701f69ead/68747470733a2f2f6c6561666c65742e6769746875622e696f2f4c6561666c65742e49636f6e2e476c7970682f64656d6f2e706e67)
Do you see how you can only see the tip of the bottom-most markers? That's because the `zIndex` of the markers in the bottom row is greater than in the second row, which have a `zIndex` greater than those in the third row, and so on. The `zIndex` is not arbitrary. It grows by 1 for every pixel down. It also gets recalculated on zooming and some view resets.
Thus, the zIndex**Offset** option is an **offset** which applies to the seemingly arbitrary `zIndex`. Thus, if I wanted the center marker to be on top of the rest, I'd set a `zIndexOffset` of at least the height of a marker, and it would look like:

777,235832393,308399544,None,"Hi,
Thanks for your quick response.
I've found this behavior right now and from my perspective it's definitely wrong...
Suppose you have only 2 markers on the map, A is above the B in pixels perspective. Then A will always appear below the B in zIndex means. But if I'll drag the A to be positioned below B in pixels perspective and leave it, after this action A will appear on top of B in zIndex meaning. Each marker dragging recalculates its zIndex. This results in incorrect behavior in our app.
What we need is to allow drawing several segments of polylines. Each segment is just several polylines connected while each tip of the segment and each connection of 2 polylines are marked with markers.
Then suppose I have 2 such segments while their markers appear wherever you like on the map in a mixed mode. But what I need is the ability to have one of the segments active and each of its markers shown on top of markers of inactive segment. But in case any marker of the active segment is very close to a marker of inactive segment and the marker of active segment appears below the marker of inactive segment in pixels perspective, it will appear under the marker of inactive segment which is wrong and I have no tool to make it work in a correct way with the logic you provide.
What can be done about it?"

As I've already said: [map panes](http://leafletjs.com/examples/map-panes/). You can have the markers for the """"active"""" segment drawn on a different pane, which has a static `zIndex` relative to the other panes. Note that `zIndexOffset` applies to the `zIndex` of the DOM elements *inside* a pane, but you can control the `zIndex` of the parent DOM element, which is the pane."
779,235832393,308401455,None,"Okay, I'll check the panes. It may help me solve the segments problem but then appears a problem with markers of the same segment.
In case 2 markers are close to each other and the one that should be active is below the other that is inactive the same problem will reappear..

That's the point that in case I could have managed the actual zIndex of markers on the map it would solve everything since I could have just decided that all active objects may have zIndex above 500 and all others will have below that. Then I should have just change values of last active objects zIndexes below 500 and the newly activated one above etc. And zIndexes of markers within a specific segment also could have similar logic, i.e below 550 inactive, above 550 - active.

No. It means that you have to reset the `zIndexOffset` of a marker whenever it changes state from inactive to active, or from inactive to active.
> This way we'll reach enormous values for zIndex which also seems not good...
A `zIndex` is an integer which can go up to the millions, and we *never* had any issue with high values. We do know that some browsers have a limit on integer CSS properties of 2^23 (see https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/commit/c5172f3088b820325e726f57f0b09b16b1ec498d, https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/commit/17c180e1eff97932c3450447d5d17fda199f7c2c), but `zIndex`es have never been a big problem, because Leaflet recalculates them once in a while on every `viewreset`, so the values for both the CSS transforms and the `zIndex`es are within a manageable range.
In my experience, it's better to learn about the [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/Stacking_without_z-index) than to be afraid of misusing `z-index`.
> That's the point that in case I could have managed the actual zIndex of markers on the map it would solve everything [...]
No you wouldn't, because if you're not resetting the `zIndex`es of the markers which transition from active to inactive, you would end up with the same problem.
I mean, if you want to *really* try if your logic would work without Leaflet's management of `zIndex`/`zIndexOffset`, you can manually disable it with something like
```js
L.Marker.prototype._updateZIndex = function(offset) {
// this._icon.style.zIndex = this._zIndex + offset;
}
```
So far, you've been subtly suggesting that Leaflet is the culprit and that your logic is infallible. [Programmers like myself don't react well to this kind of bug reporting](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html#symptoms). I bet you a beer that the problem is in the logic in your side, and that it won't matter if you manage raw `zIndex`es or `zIndexOffset`s.
If you can *isolate* a case where Leaflet fails to raise a marker's `zIndex` when raising its `zIndexOffset`, of fails to lower it, please do share a playground or similar."
789,235832393,308423228,None,"> you can manually disable it
Thanks for the suggestion. I'll try it out. It also gave me an insight on how you implement the layouting.
> your logic is infallible
Not at all. :) I just think that the API should allow disabling the recalculation of `zIndex`es and allow the API customer break his own head on how to implement what he needs.
> If you can _isolate_ a case where Leaflet fails...
The scenario is extremely simple. Use `zIndexOffset` for 2 markers with difference of 5. Since the zIndex that each marker gets from your algorithm is hundreds you may come up with the following:
`zIndexOffset(A) > zIndexOffset(B)` set by the code
but
`zIndex(A) < zIndex(B)` calculated by leaflet
And since `zIndex` is recalculated on each map operation: drag, move, zoom etc. there's no way to get the actual difference in `zIndexOffset` for markers to make it work correctly for `zIndex`es that will be calculated."
790,235832393,308427016,None,"Well, finally I came up with a solution that works fine for me:
Since in your algo you just sum the `zIndex` calculated by leaflet and `zIndexOffset` provided from outside and since all `zIndex`es you deal with are hundreds I'm just working with `zIndexOffset`s in multiplications of 1000s. A bit dirty but it does the job.

818,239227953,313492245,None,Would be also good if 'ansible-vault view' worked for such files.

As a user, what would you expect the decrypted file to look like?
First thought is just to replace the !vault yaml scalar with the decrypted text. That probably makes the most sense for 'view'.
For 'decrypt' and especially 'edit', I'm not sure that will be sufficient. For 'edit', the re-encrypt phrase is going to need to be able to figure out which variable values originally came from a vaulted value. Especially if the file is edited significantly (reordering lines for example, or changing the variable name). So the file presented for editing would need to include some markers indicating the text that was decrypted/should be re-encrypted. A couple of ways to do that:
1) Add comments to mark the text, and doing some text manipulation/regexes to replace it with encrypted text in place. Something like:
``` yaml
# START VAULT PLAINTEXT - my_var
my_var: my text goes here
# END VAULT PLAINTEXT - my_var
some_plain_var: blippy
```
2) Add a new yaml type indicating text to be encrypted. Something like:
``` yaml
my_var: !vault-plaintext |
my text goes here
some_plain_var: blippy
```
It would be best if we could yaml parse the input, decrypt the value, serialize the yaml to a file for editing, let user edit it, then yaml parse the results, encrypt the value, and serialize to yaml and save.
But... doing that with the available yaml parser would lose comments and ordering of maps.
So likely some in place string/text manipulations will be required."

We have lots of passwords as vaulted variables, hence updating\viewing them is troublesome.
I did some script (based on solution, from alikins last post) to at least parse such yml and decrypt every variable to stdout\file to see a decrypted file at once, but this is just a script that is not a complete solution (and it is decrypting only).
UPD: I ended up going thru ansible code to understand how it works with encrypted variables and wrote some tiny script that I can use in my automation jobs with Jenkins. I hope it would be useful for anyone who is waiting for this issue to be fixed.

During the encrypt phase, it would convert any unencrypted values to encrypted values.

Instead of a specific var, you can have ansible dump all vars (encrypted and plain) by specifying `-a var=""vars""`. There will be some noise in the result with a few stock vars, but it's a nice way to see everything at once.
You can also specify multiple source files by passing multiple `-e ""@...""` args.
Also, I haven't tested this personally but you can apparently avoid the implicit `localhost` warnings by setting `ANSIBLE_LOCALHOST_WARNING=false` on Ansible 2.6+.
All together:
```
ANSIBLE_LOCALHOST_WARNING=false ansible localhost -m debug -a var=""vars"" \
-e ""@file1.yml"" -e ""@path/to/file2.yml"" -e ""@path/to/file3.yml""

Ultimately I don't think it's particularly useful for users (it just drops one character), introduces some backwards incompatibility concerns and it undoes a learning I made back when Jinja2 was originally released.
The reason the package renamed with 2.0 was that there was no way (and there still is no way) to have parallel installations of Python libraries that are incompatible unlike node or rust can. Because of that I think we're going to be sooner or later again in a stupid situation where Jinja 4.0 would need to be named ""Jinja4"" on pypi.
So I think while this rename is somewhat okay I generally don't think anymore that it's a good idea. I think this change would be without concerns if the Python import system were to support imports with different versions which however I gave up hoping for."

Honestly I find your behavior completely unacceptable and hope it will have consequences."
868,245325788,574769047,Bitter frustration,~fwiw we could also release a new (point) version of `jinja2` that reexports all of `jinja` (ie it is the shim). That usually works in Rust when you have multiple dependencies that depend on another package. You'd just have to update `jinja2` to make packages that depend on `jinja2` implicitly use the types from `jinja`.~ discard this. This is exactly what the shim is doing.

Based on discussion with @ThiefMaster, it seemed that doing it in 3.0 made more sense, as it does represent a major change. We also thought about a 2.12 release for just the rename.
Jinja2 3.0 would be the shim and pull in Jinja 3.0 as a dependency."
870,245325788,574772892,None,That would probably be fine but it would prohibit using the new `jinja` name with packages that explicitly depend on `Jinja2==2.*`. Which limits the potential usefulness of the shim.

I guess 2.12 vs 3.0 comes down to deciding on if the rename is a major change even though jinja2 would continue to work and issue deprecation warnings. 3.0 was originally only going to be a major release because it dropped Python 3.

It addresses some issues that bother me in https://github.com/jbialobr/gitextensions/pull/3 These are:
1. WorkingPathProvider depends on Directory, AppSettings and GitModule static methods. These are widely used across the app. I would not like to pass them to various objects through a multiparam constructor.
2. Turning static methods into instance methods: https://github.com/jbialobr/gitextensions/pull/3/files#diff-05956b8e9b35344894a0ffe609cf32b9L376 3. Incompleteness of arranging the exterior.

This is only a sketch - there is no proper class per file and file per project separation. I am interested in discussing about the general idea of this solution.
The general idea of this solution is:
1. Wrap static methods in Gateway classes.
2. Gateway classes are singletons, they provide default implementation through public virtual members.
3. In unit tests Gateway classes are substituted in Setup method.
4. After the arrange phase unconfigured calls on substituted Gateways are not allowed."

875,249811390,322019136,None,"To set the context.
The current codebase features heavy use of inheritance and static methods.
OOP in general and inheritance in particular were all the rage about 10-15-20 years ago. As a concept it does have benefits of reuse, but it also carries downsides of maintenance overhead, complicated abstraction layers, difficult testability, side effects and surprises in behavioural changes... These days stateless interface-based implementations have become quite popular (especially with raise of functional languages) where each class has a single responsibility (or as close to that as possible) and gets all the dependencies injected via a constructor. This allows to write much cleaner and maintainable code, easier to unit test (as opposed to inheritance based classes where you would more likely be writing integration tests) and easier to alter behavior by substituting dependencies.
Another benefit of using interface-based architecture that you could plug in IoC container (e.g. autofac).
Over the years I have experience both sides, I was a big proponent of OOP but I have learnt the hard way that it makes it much harder to maintain such code, especially in large projects.
As I observed, a lot of bugs stem from implementations with overloaded concerns and lack of unit tests. As a result the code is quite confusing, inflexible and hard maintain.
In my opinion, one of the ways we could start reducing the tech debt and improving the codebase - start extracting separate concerns into individual classes and compose them as required. Gradually we would be able migrate most of the codebase. Static methods have their use too, but as any tool they have to be used appropriately."
876,249811390,322023873,None,"My main concern with DI is it often leads to the use of mocking in tests. Mocks have a strong tendency to deviate from the documented pre- and post-conditions of the original interfaces, leading to the following problems:
1. Tests are no longer executing against reality. Sometimes it's close, but it means tests are prone to both false positives (failed due to incorrect mock) and false negatives (passed even though the situation intended to be tested will fail at runtime).
2. Mocks are effectively a very clumsy DSL where logic must be manually reimplemented. Every mock necessarily reduces the long-term maintainability of the project, as well as the ability of developers to make behavior-preserving changes.
3. Mocks are not a substitute for properly covered tests. You can test code without mocks, or you can test code both with and without mocks, but mocks never save you from writing tests you would otherwise have to write.
As long as there is a clear understanding that mocks are only to be considered in the total absence of the ability to write a test using another approach, then I don't have a particular problem with either using or not using DI."

Code coverage tooling which is tightly integrated with both the code review process on GitHub as well as the supporting CI system enables developers to write mid-level tests (against API boundaries) without sacrificing overall implementation coverage. Tests written at this level, which I call ""units of behavior tests"", have these advantages:
1. They are typically easy to understand
2. They demonstrate the intended use of APIs at module boundaries (public and internal), including edge cases
3. Failure of the test is typically easy to relate to a sequence of steps a user could take to produce incorrect behavior at runtime
4. They are typically easier to design in relation to anticipated use of the application
5. When coupled with code coverage tooling, they help reveal edge cases in API usage scenarios
Note that I consider user input/interaction, file system and network activity, and operating system interaction as API boundaries that can be tested against. APIs internal to the application can be added to this set in any number of ways."

I am not sure if completely I understand your point.
If each class has a single responsibility (SR), then DI should not add any ambiguity - for each use case you set dependencies to imitate boundary conditions, but you **only** exercise and validate functionality of the class under test.
Any changes to dependencies should not have any profound effect because the class is built against a contract and not a particular implementation. Certainly a degree of coupling is possible, but it typically it will be lose coupling.
Also a SR class (usually) define a limited number of methods (accessible via an interface). As a result you test the public surface. Generally there is a limited need to test internal or private methods (due to their absence).
Another benefit of smaller classes with SR - you know exactly what each class depends on. For example right now `GitModule` spans across 3,400+ lines of code carrying hundreds of methods. And we inject this monstrosity to classes which may need to access only one method from the lot...
If a class has multiple responsibilities and/or initialises its own concrete dependencies then it is virtually impossible to perform unit testing - instead you will be writing integration tests. Any changes to dependencies with high degree of probability will necessitate changes to the class, because there is a tight coupling to concrete implementations.
Wrt: code coverage - whilst it is a very useful metric, it shouldn't be viewed as an absolute. 100% CC can be very misleading.
Personally when I write tests I usually strive for 100% coverage taking in consideration various edge cases. I use NCrunch, it helps me to visualise what cases I may have missed."

Yes, that's true. Regardless of the tools we use there is always a way to use them inappropriately.
I like to be pragmatic. For me it means: achieve maximum benefits at reasonable cost with decent safety.
Weighing those factors we have to take into account the existing code base and resources we have.
Thank you for pointing to codecov.io - it should help to find which pre-condition we lack in the test set (though 100% codecov coverage does not imply 100% pre-conditions coverage). Implementing codecov into GitExt project will show us all the most obvious pre-conditions against which should we write ""units of behavior tests"".
Then we have to write these tests, to do it, we have to weigh the factors I mentioned and decide whether to mock or to configure the exterior. I think we can't make this decision at a general level. Besides, one approach does not have to fit all concerns.

One problem I see in using mocks/spies is it often tests the implementation instead of expected behavior.
A typical unit test arranges the before state (internal and external), performs an action and asserts that the after state is equal to the expected state. Because mocked methods do not modify any external state we can not verify the after state, only asserting the expected sequence of calls on the dependencies. Changing the implementation breaks such an unit test."

I haven't worked with MEF. Until you mentioned it I am not sure I was even acutely aware of it (though I may have heard the name). On paper MEF has benefits but as well it has a number of trade offs. To me, one of the trade offs is that it doesn't seem to be widely embraced by the industry, so taking a dependency on it carries an inherent risk coupling to a technology which may become instantly obsolete (like Silverlight).
This leads to another problem - MEF requires a lot of additional ceremony (decorations). In event we want to migrate from MEF we won't be able to do so easily. If we use IoC switching containers is relatively trivial task and doesn't require re-architecture the whole app. I've just migrated our big solution from Funq to Autofac within two days and the footprint of the change was minimal. Also from what I've read MEF seems to be opaque in how it handles types, where IoC may be more transparent."

The classes under tests are stateless - they do not have any settable fields or properties (outside the container) nor they access any objects besides those passed via the container. The external dependencies are interface-based, and as such they are stateless too. So there are no side effects and there are external context mutations - so I can assert the correctness of my implementation.
The unit tests exercise my class implementations and check the flow of execution by checking how far each use case progresses and what methods within the method under test were called. There is no magic here :)
Of course there is an arrangement phase, you can't not have it. But the arrangement only sets a possible return from the underlying dependency (boundary conditions). My duty as a class developer write unit tests to account for these boundary conditions and facilitate stable predictable response.
**EDIT:**
Just realised some classes may be accessing `AppSettings` which arguably belongs to the external context, but for the most part we can presume AppSettings to be immutable. They should be abstracted too."

My point that it is still contained within Microsoft.
Given that we know how Microsoft (and other big players) drop support for their products overnight I would be very cautious investing into tech stack which is difficult to deprecate.

""... it often tests the implementation instead of expected behavior.""
The following test tests implementation.
```csharp
public void SetRemoteState_should_call_ToggleRemoteState(string remoteName, bool remoteDisabled)
{
var sections = new List<IConfigSection> { new ConfigSection(""-remote.name1"", true), new ConfigSection(""remote.name2"", true) };
_configFile.GetConfigSections().Returns(x => sections);
_controller.ToggleRemoteState(remoteName, remoteDisabled);
_configFile.Received(1).GetConfigSections();
_module.Received(remoteDisabled ? 1 : 0).RemoveRemote(remoteName);
_configFile.Received(remoteDisabled ? 0 : 1).RemoveConfigSection($""{GitRemoteController.DisabledSectionPrefix}{GitRemoteController.SectionRemote}.{remoteName}"");
_configFile.Received(1).AddConfigSection(sections[remoteDisabled ? 1 : 0]);
_configFile.Received(1).Save();
}
}
```
I would see the assert part along the lines of this:
```csharp
public void ToggleRemoteState_ChangesDisabledValue(string remoteName, bool remoteDisabled)
{
//arrange
var sections = new List<IConfigSection> { new ConfigSection(""-remote.name1"", true), new ConfigSection(""remote.name2"", true) };
_configFile.GetConfigSections().Returns(x => sections);
//act
_controller.ToggleRemoteState(remoteName, remoteDisabled);
//assert
_controler.GetRemote(remoteName).Disabled.Should().Be(!remoteDisabled);
}
}
```
This way we don't care about the implementation details, we only deal with pre and post conditions.
If the implementation changes from `remove then add` to `rename`, the first test will fail while the second will not.

Apparently we have a different understanding of ""stateless"". The config file holds a state. Invoking its methods changes this state."
890,249811390,322159927,None,"> The following test tests implementation.
Yes, because as a class developer I need to ensure the order of execution to ensure the expected behavior.
As a class consumer you don't care about it - you expect by calling a method something happens and that something happens in expected predictable manner.
Any changes to my class behaviors should only really affect my class. And for a consumer of the class the changes should be transparent. For example, as a consumer by calling `_repo.GetRecord(id: 1)` I expect to get record with id=1 - whether the record is in a database, xml file or a remote service I don't care. If repo implementaion is migrated from a database to a remote service or an xml file - it is an implementation detail for the repository implementation and I shouldn't change my implementation.
On the other hand, as a repository developer in its implementation I would probably want to make sure that the database connection is established before I attempt to interact with the database. Naturally in the repository tests I would expect to see something like `_db.Received(1).Open()`.
. . .
> Apparently we have a different understanding of ""stateless"". The config file holds a state. Invoking its methods changes this state.
Indeed we are :smile: As a consumer I interact with an interface - I don't know nor expected to care about the implementation detail of the instance given to me at runtime. By virtue of this the dependency is treated as stateless.
. . .
Btw `GitRemoteController` isn't a stateless implementation, it has a bunch of side effects and it maintains the state in `Remotes` list. So it is probably not the best example to use.
To sum it up:
We probably won't be able to make everything stateless, not from the get go anyway:
- the codebase isn't ready for it yet, and
- UI layer is typically stateful.
If we go with interface-based implementations it is much easier to write smaller SR implementations which can be easily tested. It is much easier to make implementations stateless too. You get benefits of declarative composition - it is easy to see objects connections and dependencies. As well as DI and substitutions - i.e. you could have Windows- and Linux-specific implementations without random `if running on Windows do this else do that`."

I see it totally different. As a class developer you need to ensure the expected behavior. The order of execution and the content of execution is subject of change in contrast to the expected behavior.
When you want to optimize your implementation you change it and run unit test to see if everything is ok.
When unit tests test the implementation you get tests failure."

This view makes sense. I would lean towards agreeing with it¹ on paper on both technical merits and practicality merits. However, reality of developing over time tells a very different story.
This is not only not correct, but every time I have seen it followed it's had a disastrous impact on the project. The possibility of someone with this mindset working on tests is the reason I raised my original concern above.

I don't buy it. You write a method that calls:

dep.Proc1; ... dep.Proc2;

dep.Proc3; Then you write a unit test that ensures that `dep` received these calls in the exact order. This way you verify that you implemented it the way you think it should be implemented. However if the order should be Proc3, Proc2, Proc1 your unit test does not fail. Another thing is that reading a such specified assert you don't know what is the expected state after the method execution - you only know how test writer imagine it should be implemented.

I prefer to describe tests as ""fast""/""slow"", or as ""stable""/""unstable"". A test as I described would be characterized as ""fast"", ""stable"", and also particularly well-suited to detecting regressions related to a specific scenario. When you start describing tests as ""unit"" or ""integration"", it's easy to lose sight of the fundamental purpose of testing.
The fundamental purpose of testing is to detect cases where the observable behavior of an application deviates from the expected behavior for some user scenario. I find this condition is reasonably relaxed to detecting changes in behavior under a theoretically-reachable scenario.
""Unit"" tests are a sub-optimal approximation of this that resulted from several limitations:
1. It is difficult for developers to reason about the line-level behavior of high-level testing.
1. Code coverage tooling was incomplete and/or slow, such that it was not practical to adopt as part of a team code review process.
1. High-level testing tends to be slow, unreliable, and/or difficult to stand up (e.g. only runs under a specific non-standard system configuration, or requires specialized software installations).
Code coverage tooling now performs very well, and eliminates the problems typically associated with the first item. We found that by moving away from ""unit tests"" as a goal, we were able to write tests that better represented reality. The focus instead was on test speed, stability, and independence from system configuration. The result was something between what would normally be classified as ""unit"" or ""integration"" tests - we used fakes¹ to eliminate external dependencies, and tested primarily against well-defined module boundaries². When possible, we fed inputs to the application in the same way it would actually occur for a user:
1. When testing the behavior of a subsystem, we tested using the same API that other code would be using to drive that subsystem. Code which we *couldn't* cover with this approach often meant the code was dead code under real-world conditions.
1. When testing UI controls, we actually created the control and interacted with it as a user would (yes this can be fast and reliable).
1. When testing file system, we created files and folders and tested against them. We used ACLs or chmod to force access errors and held handles open to force sharing violations.
¹ Typically stub executables or our own implementations of interfaces in code
² We applied a `[ServiceInterface]` attribute to the boundary interface, which carried special requirements. These interfaces were required to be threading agnostic, safe for concurrent use without regard for the caller (new unknown callers could appear at will), idempotent, and only ever obtained from the single service container instance. Mocking was *forbidden* for any object which was not marked with `[ServiceInterface]`. For cases where one or more of these conditions could not be met, we used `[ServiceInterface(Restricted = true)]`, and required that the restriction (often a limitation on who is allowed to call it) be documented - use of this form was seen as technical debt, but used occasionally because the correct solution was too costly at the time."

I think that at this point enough has been said and we should stop to write down the fundamental goals the tests should serve and the criteria they should meet. Only after that we can discuss how to achieve these goals and meet these criteria. These are mine:
**Goals:**
1. Ensure the expected behavior of the app. By saying expected behavior I mean that having given pre conditions the tested unit transforms the existing state into a state described by the post conditions. To be clear we should assert on the expected state not on the steps that lead to this state.
2. Document the expected behavior. **Criteria**
1. Independent from the environment - a test should arrange the environment in the way that makes it invariant regardless of changes made to the environment outside of the test.
2. Stable - a test should always produce the same result for the same starting conditions.
3. Easy to understand the pre and post conditions."

It looks like we come from different schools of thought and practice. Like yours my position comes from practical experience solving real engineering challenges.
I'm part of a small team building RAD framework and reusable components where pretty much every component can be substituted by a consumer. We have a number of major and minor releases concurrently powering hundreds of apps in production, and we provide full runtime backwards compatibility.
We can assume very little about consumers, their habits and requirements. In turn we must provide a great deal of flexibility but ensure stability of the framework core and consumer applications (to a degree). This is specifically important in security-related areas.
All of this dictates how we architect and engineer the framework, how we deal with dependencies, how we deploy and how we test.
Until we re-engineered the codebase to consist of interface based stateless single responsibility classes we had a number of challenges meeting the requirements (including production incidents). We also couldn't reason about stability and predictability of provided behaviors.
Now we have 1,800+ .NET unit tests, hundreds of JS tests and probably another few thousand of BDD tests. Some tests, especially security-related, test the order of execution - without that we can't reason about predictability, nor we can release new versions or provide backwards compatibility.
Smaller interface-based single responsibility implementations allow us to achieve * isolation (all dependencies are injected), * testability (all dependencies are mocked), * stability (via predictability), * flexibility (consumers only concern themselves with replacing a specific implementation instead of worrying about inter-dependencies). And as a bonus - our APIs are easy to register in an arbitrary IoC container."
904,249811390,322450186,None,"@RussKie Your last post really resonates with me. One of the goals I had when I was pushing so hard to switch away from mocks (on a former project) was based on the type of application being shipped to customers. As you are well aware, anything considered public API surface area has special requirements related to versioning. These requirements constrain the development team substantially, but are a great asset from the customers perspective. However, in an application where the final product is the application (as opposed to a publicly-consumable API), these same requirements *burden* the development team. I didn't like the fact that when we wanted to make a change to our implementation, we kept running into pain points (leading to delays) resembling those faced by developers trying to make changes to public APIs.
Another application (this time a library) I've contributed to over time is StringTemplate. While it has a few known extension points built in, it was never designed to be arbitrarily reconfigurable for end users. Over time it's led to a frustrating experience for a small subset of users trying to do arguably normal things, just things we didn't think of from the start. For example, by failing to abstract the file system (location and reading) away from the template loader, it's not possible to use *some* features of StringTemplate when the templates are stored e.g. in a database, or stored using a compression mechanism we didn't think of from the start. Better adherence to SRP would likely improve the long term durability and flexibility of this library.
It sounds to me like GitExtensions is unlikely to suffer from most of the problems related to reusable components, and more likely to benefit from a testing approach that focuses on application behavior.

Not to the extent of the one I've been referring to. I've started to add tests for UI related bug reports to PerfView, but these are quite limited and not particularly elegant currently.
When I built a system like this in the past, I started with the following:
1. Identify all mutable static state in the application. We will need a way to reset these to known default values between each test, ensuring that the outcome of any given test cannot influence the behavior of another (with a corollary that a test failure uniquely and deterministically identifies the culprit, which can then be executed in isolation to reproduce the failure):
* Mutable `static` fields
* File read and written
* Registry keys/values read/written
2. Identify all asynchronous operations. We will need a way to ensure that a test is not considered complete while one of these is executing (or scheduled for later execution, in the case of timers or delays).
3. Identify external dependencies for which the concrete implementation is likely problematic for high-speed deterministic testing. We will need a way to substitute the behavior of these items during testing. The method of substitution must guarantee that during the execution of any given test, all executing code is using the same implementation (either the original or the substituted one, but never a mix and never multiple substitutes).
* One obvious case is invocations of *git.exe* for many types of tests
* Loading resources from a network
Once you address the above, most tests are still written against module interface boundaries. However, when actually testing UI behaviors it's not particularly challenging to write those tests against the controls. Most of the problems typically associated with testing UI behavior are really just failures to address one of the above underlying concerns."

I am happy to do that. I don't need unit tests, I need the app to be thoroughly tested. I expressed my needs here https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/pull/3898#issuecomment-322384024
I don't want to say that asserting on implementation is always wrong. It can be helpful, but it should not be overused. I think it should be strictly limited and explicitly described when it can be used. I see to many corner cases in my mind when unit tests asserting on implementation go green and the app is not working as expected. There are even more cases I see when changing the implementation turns such unit tests into red ones. These of many assertions in a single test are the most likely to fail and the hardest to correct (I am ignoring here the fact that we should not have to correct tests for which the pre and post conditions have not changed). I don't mind writing tests that ensure a developer well understand description of the used interfaces and its operations. For example when resetting unstaged changes, I prefer to have a set of tests like:
1. Ensure staged files are untouched
2. Ensure ignored files are untouched
3. etc.
to have a test like:
1. Ensure the `git reset --hard` is executed.
>>The order of execution and the content of execution is subject of change in contrast to the expected behavior.
>This is a contradictory statement - the order of execution is one of the key factors for expected behaviour. And the content of execution should not matter at all.
Perhaps my English skills are too poor to express it correctly. I prefer to verify that the chosen by a developer sequence of execution leads to the expected state than to verify that the chosen by a developer sequence of execution is the sequence he chose. The order is indeed one of the key factors but there may exist many orders that lead to the expected behavior."

It is a copy-paste from the implementation. It is really a [test double](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_double). It doubles the implementation, it doubles the false assumption that the path separator is `\`. While unit tests are useful, they should not replace integration tests.

It does so by checking if the existing pins in the lockfile are valid candidate first when selecting candidate in the resolving. `pipenv` could probably do the same.
I think its a reasonable idea. Otherwise, if you want to update absolutely only one dependency, `pipenv` would have to have a mode to block if changing a dependency causes other changes, or else you would loose the guarantee of a valid environment.
I hope this helps!"

I am hesitant to encourage too many hacks to resolution logic, which is already complicated and difficult to debug.
@brettdh I think I can shed some light because you have most of the pieces. `pipenv lock` doesn't install anything, and it doesn't claim to. It only generates the lockfile given your host environment, python version, and a provided `Pipfile`. If you manipulate your environment in some other way or if you use pip directly/manipulate pip settings outside of pipenv / are not using `pipenv run` or using `pip freeze` inside a pipenv subshell, it is quite easy for a lockfile to be out of sync from `pip freeze`. The two aren't really related.
To be clear:
1. `Pipfile.lock` is a strictly-pinned dependency resolution using the pip-tools resolver based on the user's `Pipfile`
2. If you want to maintain strict pins of everything while upgrading only one package, I believe you can do this by strictly pinning everything in your `Pipfile` except for the one thing you want to upgrade (correct me if I'm wrong @vphilippon)
As for your lockfile and `pip freeze` disagreeing with one another, I'd have to know more information, but I believe we have an open issue regarding our lockfile resolver when using non-system versions of python to resolve."

953,268049628,339676768,None,"@techalchemy I mentioned the `pip freeze` difference as a shorthand for ""the package versions that `pipenv install` installs differ from the package versions that `pipenv lock` saves to `Pipfile.lock`.""
True, this only happens when I've changed pip's default args via environment variable; I was just pointing out that it was surprising that pipenv delegated to pip for installation but not for version locking; i.e. rather than locking what's installed, it locks what it thinks *should* be installed, potentially with unrequested upgrades.
Could you clarify your question a bit? I think ""resolving with pip-tools"" is referring to what `pipenv lock` is doing, and the reason it's not affected when I set pip defaults? And could you be more specific about what you mean by ""this behavior""?"
954,268049628,339707418,None,"@brettdh The locking mechanism include a notion of ""dependency resolution"" that does not exist in `pip`. Its handled by `pip-tools` (or rather, a patched version of it, integrated in a special way by `pipenv` that bring a few differences with the original tool). In short, the locking mechanism reads the `Pipfile` and performs a full dependency resolution to select a full set of package that will meet *every* constraints defined by the required packages *and their dependencies*.
@techalchemy > [...] it’s resolving with pip-tools that concerns me.
I'm not sure how those `--upgrade-strategy` would affect `pip-tools`, because it works on some low-level internals of `pip`. I have the feeling this would not give the expected result, as these option take into account what's installed, and that's not what's being dealt with in that mechanism. But we have another approach to this in `pip-tools` that could be done here.
The ""original"" `pip-tools` behavior is that it only updates what's is needed in the lockfile (in its context, its the requirements.txt), but this was ""lost"" in the way the resolver was integrated in `pipenv`. Let me explain why.
Pointing back to my resume of how `pip-tools` works: https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/issues/875#issuecomment-337717817
Remember the ""select a candidate"" part? That's done by querying the `Repository` object.
In `pipenv`, we directly configure a `PyPIRepository` for the `Resolver`, but `pip-tools` does something else, it uses a `LocalRequirementsRepository` object, which keeps the existing pins from the previously existing `requirements.txt` (if found), and ""fallbacks"" on `PyPIRepository`.
So in `pip-tools`, the following happens when selecting a candidate:
1. Query `LocalRequirementsRepository` for a candidate that match `foobar>=1.0,<2.0`.
1. Check if an existing pin meets that requirements:
- If yes, return that pin as the candidate.
- If not, query the `proxied_repository` (`PyPIRepository`) for the candidate.
1. Use the candidate returned
Effectively, it means that existing pins are given a ""priority"" as candidate to try first.
But in `pipenv`, currently, it simply:
1. Query `PyPIRepository` (directly) for a candidate that match `foobar>=1.0,<2.0`.
1. Use the candidate returned.
So, I think the same behavior for the locking in `pipenv` could be done by parsing the `Pipfile.lock` to get the existing pins and use a `LocalRequirementsRepository`, like `pip-tools` does in its `pip-compile` command."
955,268049628,339749088,None,@vphilippon do you have a sense of how difficult implementation on that would be?
956,268049628,339791934,None,"@techalchemy - Parsing the `Pipfile.lock` to extract the existing pins: Haven't looked at that. Depends on how things are structured in `pipenv`. We need a set of `InstallRequirements` that represents the pins in the `Pipfile.lock`.
- Using `LocalRequirementsRepository`: Fairly easy: change our current `PyPIRepository` for a `LocalRequirementsRepository`.
---------------
But, as I'm looking into this, and following @brettdh comments, I realize a few things:
1. The current default `pipenv install` behavior doesn't match the `pipenv lock` behavior. Doing `pipenv install requests` alone won't update `requests` if a new version comes out (much like straight `pip install`). However, doing `pipenv lock` will update the `Pipfile.lock` with the latest version of `requests` that matches the `Pipfile` specifier, and the dependency constraints.
There's 2 main way to see this:
- A) The `Pipfile.lock` should stay as stable as possible by default, not changing pins unless required, in order to stay like the current environment, and only change in the event that we change the environment.
- B) The `Pipfile.lock` should get the newest versions that respect the environment constrains/dependencies in order to freely benefit from the open ranges in the `Pipfile` and lib dependencies, allowing to continuously acquire new compatible versions in your environment. You can then run `pipenv update` to benefit from the fresh lock.
IMHO, I would align the default behavior, which would be to go with A) by default. Because right now, everytime a lock is performed (i.e. after each installation), new versions can come in, which make the lockfile *drive the update of the environment*, which seems weird. But, this is arguable of course. While in development, I might want to continuously update my requirements to no get stale, like with B), so that should also be easily doable.
2. Even if we use `LocalRequirementsRepository` to avoid updating correct existing pins, and end up aligning the default behaviors, we then need to address the equivalent of `--upgrade` and `--upgrade-strategy` for the locking part. Currently, defining some environment variable (like `PIP_UPGRADE` and `PIP_UPGRADE_STRATEGY`) will affect the `pipenv install` behavior, but will not affect `pipenv lock`, as it doesn't affect the behavior of `pip-tools` (I confirmed that, as I was unsure at first).
Otherwise, there will be no way to update the environment without either deleting the `Pipfile.lock` (feels clunky, and ""all or nothing"") or *requiring* a newer version (I mean doing an explicit `pipenv install requests>2.18.4`, which requires you to *know* that a new version is out, and changes the specifier in the `Pipfile` itself, increasing the lower bound), which is wrong. As the ""original `pip-tools`"" doesn't deffer to `pip` to deal with this (as it's not related that what is currently installed), it offers an option to specify the dependencies to update in the lockfile, and simply remove the pins for these packages (or all) from the existing_pins list, effectively falling back to querying PyPI. I'm not sure how we can match the notion of ""--upgrade-strategy"" with this.
---------------
@techalchemy So while I was saying it was fairly easy to just ""align the default behavior"", I now realize that this would cause some major issue with being able to update the packages (as in: just fetch the latest version that match my current constraints).
If there's something unclear, ask away, a lot of editing went on when writing this.
(Dependency resolution is not easy. Good and practical dependency resolution is even worst 😄 )"
957,268049628,339807198,None,"@vphilippon that's exactly what I meant. Keeping the things that pip installs in sync with the things that pip-tools resolves is non-trivial unless you drive the process backwards, using the resolved lockfile to do the installation. I'm pretty sure that was why things were designed the way they were. > B) The Pipfile.lock should get the newest versions that respect the environment constrains/dependencies in order to freely benefit from the open ranges in the Pipfile and lib dependencies, allowing to continuously acquire new compatible versions in your environment. You can then run pipenv update to benefit from the fresh lock.
This workflow can possibly work with the current configuration. You can use `pipenv lock` to generate a lockfile, but `pipenv update` will reinstall the whole environment. I'm pretty sure we can use one of our various output formats to resolve the dependency graph (we already have a json format as you know) and only reinstall things that don't align to the lockfile. This might be more sensible, but I would be curious about the input of @nateprewitt or @erinxocon before making a decision"
958,268049628,339954048,None,"@vphilippon Totally agree that A and B are desirable workflows in different situations. Some of your phrasing around B confused me a bit, though, seeming to say that `pipenv lock` might result in a lockfile that doesn't actually match the environment - I particularly heard this in that one would need to ""run `pipenv update` to benefit from the fresh lock"" - as if the lock is ""ahead"" of the environment rather than matching it.
Regardless of whether you are in an A workflow or a B workflow, a few things seem constant to me, and I think this squares with what @techalchemy is saying as well:
* The result of `pipenv lock` should always be a lockfile that matches the environment.
* The result of `pipenv install` should always be an environment that matches the lockfile.
I'm ignoring implementation details, but that's kind of the baseline behavior I expect from a package manager with a lockfile feature.
Running `pipenv update` periodically allows you to stay in B mode as long as you want everything to be fresh, and having the ability to `pipenv install --upgrade requests` would allow specific updates of one package and its dependencies, without affecting packages that don't need to be upgraded unnecessarily.
Am I missing any use cases? I can think of optimizations for B - e.g. a flag or env var that tells it to always update eagerly - but I think that covers the basics. I also know I'm retreading ground you've already covered; it's just helpful for me to make sure I understand what you're talking about. :)"

@brettdh this is correct -- the `pip-tools` resolver we use to generate `Pipfile.lock` doesn't ask the virtualenv for a list of which packages have been installed. Instead, it compiles a list of packages that meet the criteria specified in the list of pins from the `Pipfile`. Because the resolver itself runs using the system or outer python / pipenv / pip-tools install, we are doing some supreme fuckery to convince it to resolve packages with the same version of python used in the virtualenv. The assumption would be that `pip install` would resolve things similarly, but that isn't always the case, although even I'm not 100% sure about that. But yes, `pipenv lock` is not generated based on the virtualenv, it is generated based on the `Pipfile`. It is a dependency resolution lockfile, not an environment state pin."
960,268049628,344127642,None,"As a potential resolution to this: something that pip itself currently supports, but `pip-compile` doesn't, is the notion of a constraints file.
A constraints file differs from a requirements file, in that it says ""*If* this component is installed, then it *must* meet this version constraint"". However, if a particular package in the constraints file doesn't show up in the dependency tree anywhere, it doesn't get added to the set of packages to be installed.
This is the feature that's currently missing from `pipenv`, as the desired inputs to the `Pipfile.lock` generation are:
1. The updated `Pipfile` contents as a new requirements input file
2. The full set of existing dependencies from `Pipfile.lock` as a constraints file, excluding the packages specifically named in the current command
Constraints file support at the pip-tools resolver level would then be enough for `pipenv` to support a mode where attempted implicit upgrades of dependencies would fail as a constraint violation, allowing the user to decide whether or not they wanted to add that package to the set being updated."

```
I find it really annoying having to communicate this to my team members. The alternative seems to be to pin everything to exact versions in `Pipfile`, but that defeats much of the purpose of using pipenv in the first place.
IIUC, this behavior is the equivalent of `apt` performing an implicit `apt dist-upgrade` whenever you run `apt install foo`.
This is made worse by the fact that `pipenv install` updates stuff in `Pipfile.lock`, but does not install the updates into the local virtualenv. If the developer does not carefully examine the diff of `Pipfile.lock`, they are still using the older versions locally, but once they share the code, all other environments see the surprising updates.

I think it's slightly surprising but not completely unreasonable that pipenv interprets `foo = ""*""` to mean ""I just need to make sure _some_ version of foo is installed, the user doesn't care which"". To that end, having something like `pipenv install --pin foo` which results in `foo = ""==1.2.3""` instead of `foo = ""*""` in the Pipfile (where 1.2.3 is the current latest version of foo) seems like it might help.
The issue with this though is that the behavior of a lot of packages can change a lot based on their dependencies (e.g., the same version of pylint can do totally different things depending on what version of astroid it's using), and packages don't pin their own deps exactly.

The new dependency is PyYAML, let say the latest version. If you install it in any new environment with `pip`, you will see that the library does not add any dependency, so only PyYAML is installed, is that simple in these cases with Pip. But adding the dependency with Pipenv (because a project that I didn't create is managed with Pipenv) the same issue happened, despite PyYAML doesn't have any dependency, and it's not previously installed in the project (an older version), `pipenv` updates all my dependencies in the lock file and the virtual environment, but I don't want to update the others dependencies, I just one to add a single new module without any dependency.

Why though? I never understood this idea that you should manage the dependencies of a library and an application differently. The only difference between the two is the lock file which is needed for an application to ensure a reproducible environment. Other than that it's the same thing. This is the standard in most other languages and Python seems the exception here for some reason and this is bad from a user experience standpoint since this is making things more complex than they should be.

I understand that the issue tracker is most a place where to discuss bugs and improvements, and discuss whether this is a bug or an error by design is not clear in the thread, but again my apologies.
I thing there are two strong topics here:
- Should pipenv update all your outdated dependencies where you are trying just to install a new dependency: the ones that are not needed to update because the new package / version we are trying to install can works with the existent dependencies, and even the ones that aren't dependencies of the new package we are trying to install? Maybe this is out of scope of this ticket, but it's a really important topic to discuss.
- Do one of these parameters `--keep-outdated` `--selective-upgrade` allow us to avoid these behaviour? It's not clear what these options do, there is a lack of documentation about them, and even in the related issue (#1554) nobody is answering that.
In case it's a bug in on one of these params `--keep-outdated` `--selective-upgrade`, I still thinking that do not set whatever param solves the unnecessary update of the dependencies as default it's a really bad idea.
To compare with a similar scenario, imagine that you execute `apt-get install vim` to just install the `vim` tool in your system (and the necessary vim's dependencies or updates if apply), but imagine also that in this situation apt updates all the other dependencies of your system: python, the QT system, the Linux kernel... and so on. It's not that apt shouldn't allow us to updates other dependencies, but there is a clear command to do that: `apt-get upgrade`, while `apt-get install PACKAGE` just install / update PACKAGE and it's dependencies."

`pyproject.toml` isn't really supported for library definition metadata -- and not at all by any version of pip that doesn't implement peps 517 and 518 (both of which are still having implementation details worked out) as an authoritative library declaration file. `setup.cfg` exists for that purpose (the actual successor to `setup.py` ) and IMHO both of those should really be supported. A library is published and intended for consumption with abstract dependencies so that they can play nice in the sandbox with others; applications are usually large, complex beasts with sometimes hundreds of direct dependencies. So one of our main divergences is that when we design and build our tooling, we take this into account also
@mrsarm For your first question, the update behavior was intentional (and was discussed extensively at the time, /cc @ncoghlan and related to OWASP security concerns). On the second point, the behavior is currently not properly implemented which is why the issue is still opened, which led us to rewriting the backing resolver behind pipenv, which I mentioned above. It simply didn't support this behavior. `--selective-upgrade` is supposed to selectively upgrade only things that are dependencies of the new package, while `--keep-outdated` would hold back anything that satisfied the dependencies required by a new package.

Well this is certainly off topic but it's an important discussion so I can't help myself.
There is actually no standard around `setup.cfg` right now other than the conventions established by distutils and setuptools. `pyproject.toml` is absolutely for library metadata as the successor to `setup.py` or the community would have placed build requirements in `setup.cfg` instead. `pyproject.toml` describes how to build a project (PEP 518), and part of building is describing metadata. I'm NOT saying that `pyproject.toml` needs a standard location for this metadata, but PEP 518 uses this file to install a build tool and from there it's very reasonable to expect that the build tool will use declarative configuration from somewhere else in the file to determine how to build the project.
Anyway, going back to pipenv vs poetry - there seems to be some idea floating around that applications don't need certain features that libraries get, like entry points, and this is just incorrect. It should be straightforward for an application to be a python package.
The only true difference between an application and a library in my experience with python and with other ecosystems is whether you're using a lockfile or not. Of course there's a third case where you really just want a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` and no actual code and that seems to be all that pipenv has focused on so far (`pipenv install -e .` falls into this category as pipenv is still afraid to try and support the package metadata). Unfortunately, while the design of pipenv is cleaner with this approach, it's also way less useful for most applications because PEP 518 decided to punt on how to install projects into editable mode so in order to continue using pipenv we will be stuck on setuptools quite a while longer as you cannot use `pyproject.toml` to switch away from setuptools and still use `pipenv install -e .`."

This came up on the mailing list recently -- nothing anywhere has declared a standard around `pyproject.toml` other than that it will be used to declare build system requirements. Anything else is an assumption; you can call that ""library definition metadata"", but it isn't. Try only defining a build system with no additional information about your project (i.e. no pep-345 compliant metadata) and upload it to pypi and let me know how that goes.

That's correct, it is not a ""standard"", yet in that same thread recognise that by calling it `pyproject.toml` they likely asked for people to use this file for other project related settings/config.
So by the same logic you invoked here:
> Distutils is part of the standard library and setuptools is installed with pip now, so saying that there is no standard is a bit silly.
`pyproject.toml` is a standard, and the community has adopted it as the standard location to place information related to the build system, and other parts of a Python project."

PEP 517 punted on editable installs... which means there is no standard way to install a project in editable mode if you are not using setup tools (which has a concept known as develop mode which installs the project in editable mode)."

Yes, the build system is expected to output the PKG-INFO file described in PEP 345. This is a transfer format that goes in an sdist or wheel and is generated from a setup.py/setup.cfg, it is not a replacement as such for the user-facing metadata. PEP 518's usage of `pyproject.toml` is about supporting alternatives to distutils/setuptools as a build system, no one is trying to replace the sdist/wheel formats right now. Those replacement build systems need a place to put their metadata and fortunately PEP 517 reserved the `tool.` namespace for these systems to do so. It's not an assumption - **both flit and poetry have adopted this namespace for ""library definition metadata"".**
> Try only defining a build system with no additional information about your project (i.e. no pep-345 compliant metadata) and upload it to pypi and let me know how that goes.
How constructive.
> Who is saying that applications don't require entry points? Pipenv has an entire construct to handle this.
Where is this construct? I cannot even find the word ""entry"" on any page of the pipenv documentation at https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ so ""an entire construct"" sounds pretty far fetched? If you mean editable installs then we have reached the point I was making above - with pipenv deciding to couple itself to `pipenv install -e .` as the only way to hook into and develop an application as a package, for the foreseeable future pipenv's support here is coupled to setuptools. I think the entire controversy boils down to this point really and people (certainly me) are frustrated that we can now define libraries that don't use setuptools but can't develop on them with pipenv. To be perfectly clear this isn't strictly pipenv's fault (PEP 518 decided to punt on editable installs), but its refusal to acknowledge the issue has been frustrating in the discourse as poetry provides an alternative that does handle this issue in a way that's compliant with the `pyproject.toml` format. Pipenv keeps saying that poetry makes bad decisions but does not actually attempt to provide a path forward."

Great, and we are happy to accommodate sdists and wheels built using this system and until there is a standard for editable installs we will continue to pursue using pip to build sdists and wheels and handle dependency resolution that way.

The authors and maintainers of pip, of the peps in question, and myself and @uranusjr are pretty well versed on the differences between editable installs and the implications of building them under the constraints of pep 517 and 518.

In fact -- we have pretty great resolution of dependencies now that will update within the constraints you specify in your `Pipfile` to what is the possible allowed latest versions where all specifiers and constraints are met, or otherwise it will error out and let you know that you cannot do that.

except:

----
Quoting the PEP
```
When catching exceptions, mention specific exceptions whenever possible instead of using a bare except: clause.
For example, use:
try:
import platform_specific_module
except ImportError:
platform_specific_module = None
A bare except: clause will catch SystemExit and KeyboardInterrupt exceptions, making it harder to interrupt a program with Control-C, and can disguise other problems. If you want to catch all exceptions that signal program errors, use except Exception: (bare except is equivalent to except BaseException:).
A good rule of thumb is to limit use of bare 'except' clauses to two cases:
1. If the exception handler will be printing out or logging the traceback; at least the user will be aware that an error has occurred.
2. If the code needs to do some cleanup work, but then lets the exception propagate upwards with raise. try...finally can be a better way to handle this case.
```
As a *general* rule, this new check is good. There are specific cases where people will need to do general clean-up work, as described above. Since we cannot check for people re-raising the exception in the except block, it truly is up to the user to determine whether:
1. This check is useful to them at all or whether they feel it should be ignored globally
2. Their particular use of a bare `except` is necessary and it should be ignored in that particular case (e.g., with `# noqa` or `# noqa: E722`).
I would hazard a guess that 90% of pycodestyle's users will find this check worthwhile, useful, and helpful. We can not ever satisfy 100% of our users so I am happy to settle for 90%."
1030,271165698,342886428,None,"I have two (real world) scenarios:
1. Legacy code, initially written by novices, with inappropriate use of bare except all over the place. E722 is helpful there (somewhat since this usually isn't the only issue in such legacy code, and you end up ignoring most errors there anyway).
2. Code written by me (and similarly experienced Python developers), where bare except is used occasionally, but never without re-raising the exception. For reference, E722 is reported inappropriately three times in [this project](https://github.com/snoack/mypass) of mine, where the exception is re-raised.
If the design of pycodestyle doesn't allow considering the following block, in order to avoid inappropriate errors, my understanding is, that due to the potential of false positives this check should not be enabled by default, or such a check should rather be implemented in pyflakes which considers the AST and therefore is able to ignore bare excepts that re-raise the exception.

1036,271165698,370050577,Entitlement,"I'm with @sigmavirus24 on this one, but I'd take it a little further: a bare except is inherently unpythonic. Two important parts of python philosophy (`import this`) are 'Explicit is better than implicit' and 'Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.'. I point these out because a bare except is a special, highly implicit case. Every other `except` has an 'argument', indicating the scope of the error to be handles. Even if that's 'everything', it's better to explicitly state that.
'There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.' also applies, since you can accomplish the same thing for the low-low price of 14 characters. That's simply not enough of a 'savings' to make it worth it.
There's also the fact that things like KeyboardInterrupt aren't caught by `Exception` for a reason. Those represent *very* exceptional cases - cases which shouldn't occur in normal (e.g. production) operation unless something has gone very wrong or the user is explicitly requesting an immediate shutdown.
In regards to @lordmauve's case: Why do you want to clean up those temporary files in every possible exception case? `except:` tells me that you don't know what exceptions may be raised. In those (hopefully rare) cases, your app will certainly crash (unless you have a bare except that silences every possible exception, but that's a whole new level of bad design), and you will probably need to investigate why. A temporary file is part of the state of the application at the point in time, and therefore will be forensically valuable.
If you know for sure that the temporary file will be forensically worthless, then `except Exception:` or `except BaseException:` makes that clear, and indicates that you're fully aware of the implications. If you're more worried about old temporary files accumulating in some way, consider having your app do cleanup as part of initialization. That idea comes from the [Crash-only software](https://lwn.net/Articles/191059/) pattern (It's a lot more reasonable than it sounds, I promise). Basically, it's a lot easier to assume that your app always terminates unexpectedly and code against that than to handle unexpected termination as a special case (i.e. Turning off the power is guaranteed to be an option, but a shut down command may fail or be unavailable).
As a last resort, there's always ` # noqa`. If you absolutely must break from best practices, then 8 characters is a very small price to pay.

> Those represent very exceptional cases - cases which shouldn't occur in normal (e.g. production) operation unless something has gone very wrong or the user is explicitly requesting an immediate shutdown.
This sounds like you're assuming all development is on continuously running applications on a remote server. Things like pycodestyle and flake8 are ""production"" applications that should handle `KeyboardInterrupt`. That said, both projects handle it explicitly. I think I understand your point, but it feels like it's imposing a false dichotomy around what is ""production"".
> Why do you want to clean up those temporary files in every possible exception case?
I can imagine a few cases where @lordmauve would want to (and should!) clean up the temporary files. Perhaps those temporary files contain some sensitive information and cleaning them up is the secure thing to do. In reality, neither of us know the details and I think we should be assuming that they know their constraints better than us. Of course having some non-sensitive temporary files lying around can be useful for debugging, but there are certainly valid cases where those shouldn't be left around no matter what exception happens."
1038,271165698,370182512,Impatience,"@sigmavirus24 I think you're right re: imposing a false dichotomy - I'm primarily a web developer, where the dichotomy is pretty reliable.
In regards to temporary files containing sensititive information, Wouldn't it be a risk to write them to disk at all? If the power is shut off at the right moment, the data would still be there on disk, and no exception handling would have a chance to clean it up. So that makes me think that a temporary file is the wrong tool in the first place. I'd want to keep that in something volatile (like memory) so that it's sort of fail-safe.
You're more general point is a good one. - We can't know the real requirements on a project we're not a part of. But if those requirements do require a cleanup in all exception cases, I think we probably agree that it should be done explicitly."
1039,271165698,370185344,Impatience,"> I'd want to keep that in something volatile (like memory) so that it's sort of fail-safe.

- In the case of temporary files, never leave them around on a production server because they can cause additional impact (eg. filling a disk volume) which can be much more serious than the original crash. Reproduce the issue in dev and diagnose.
- Just came across another example: in the case that my event loop crashes due to programming error, I must kill my subprocesses which are now in an unknown state ([code](https://github.com/lordmauve/chopsticks/blob/master/chopsticks/tunnel.py#L130))."

Junior people are often two or three steps removed from people who could confidently tell you what good practice looks like.

PyFlakes wouldn't accept this for the very reason that it's so controversial. They only accept obvious problems, e.g., unused imports. If this isn't satisfactory here, a different stylistic option for having it would be via a Flake8 AST plugin. Luckily, `flake8-bugbear` already provides this check using the AST but a quick check of the source indicates that it's as strict as this check is. I'd suggest either collaborating with [bugbear](/pycqa/flake8-bugbear) or creating a new plugin that meets the specific needs.

##### OS / ENVIRONMENT

##### SUMMARY
I need to conditionally import a playbook, which isn't possible. The keyword I'm missing is ""include_playbook"" which would allow a ""when"" to apply to it. Why?
I have a playbook that performs some maintenance, OS, Kernel, package, and firmware upgrades. For Major upgrades, we track progress in a ticketing system. So, during those runs, I'd like to conditionally import a playbook that updates the ticket information. In order for that to work, I need to pass the user's password to the ticketing system, so there's a `vars_prompt` in the ticket update playbook. If the user specifies which ticket they're working to the maintenance playbook, I'd like the ticket update playbook to be called after the maintenance is performed.
If there's another way for this to work, I'm open to alternate ideas, but I think conditionally playbook imports would be generically useful. I'm not understanding why tasks could be included dynamically, but a playbook wouldn't be.

I suppose this could be split up into two (2) separate playbooks in the same Git repo.

ansible-playbook ... prepare.yml playbook.yml
Any variables that you set on the command line are passed to the playbooks, sequentially.
This might also solve [MarSik's](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/34281#issuecomment-361277446) problem, also, using file globbing on the command line instead of in the playbook."
1086,284999235,495339159,None,"@decet It could, but that would basically mean using a top level bash script as the entrypoint and spliting the main ansible playbook into multiple stage files. Not too horrible, just ugly."
1087,284999235,495431953,None,"I've overcome this in my own way as follows. First, my typical playbook directory structure:
```bash
.
├── .ansible-lint
├── .gitignore
├── .yamllint
├── ansible.cfg
├── callback_plugins
│   ├── junit.py
│   ├── log_plays.py
│   ├── profile_roles.py
│   ├── profile_tasks.py
│   ├── timer.py
├── check_ansible_lint.sh
├── check_syntax.sh
├── check_yaml_lint.sh
├── create.yml
├── destroy.yml
├── Jenkinsfile
├── localhost_inventory.yml
├── playbooks
│   ├── ap_linux_instance
│   └── requirements.yml
├── prerequisites.yml
├── README.md
├── reports
├── requirements.txt
├── roles
│   ├── ar_linux_ansible_venv
│   ├── ar_linux_cname
│   ├── config_encoder_filters
│   └── requirements.yml
└── VERSION.md
```
My .gitignore ignores most sane OS/language/IDE things, but also ignores everything in the `roles/` and `playbooks/` folders except for the `requirements.yml` files in each folder. The requirements.yml file within the playbooks folder is similar to your Galaxy-style requirements.yml, but rather than calling out dependent playbooks by Galaxy owner.name, I specify the full Git source (Galaxy supports this of course). The requirements.yml within the roles/ folder is just your traditional Galaxy-style requirements.
I have this `prerequisites.yml` playbook, that looks like this:
```yaml
---
- name: PLAY | Install other required playbooks
hosts: localhost
connection: local
tasks:
- name: INCLUDE_VARS | include variables to discover other needed playbooks
include_vars:
dir: playbooks/
files_matching: requirements.yml
depth: 1
- name: GIT | Clone playbooks
git:
repo: ""{{ item.src }}""
dest: ""playbooks/{{ item.src.split('/')[-1] }}""
version: ""{{ item.version }}""
loop: ""{{ required_playbooks }}""
- name: SHELL | Install included playbooks roles
shell: ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements.yml -p roles/ --force
args:
chdir: ""playbooks/{{ item.src.split('/')[-1] }}""
loop: ""{{ required_playbooks }}""
when: item.galaxy
changed_when: false
tags: [ skip_ansible_lint ]
```
And, assuming that my ""big bang"" create.yml depends on a playbook and its roles from another playbook project, I import it like this:
```yaml
# ~~~~~~~~~~
# Ensure that all of the host VMs in the inventory are up and running
# either on-prem or in Azure as specified in the inventory
#
- name: Ensure inventory hosts are present
import_playbook: ""playbooks/ap_linux_instance/create.yml""
tags: [ base_server, hosts ]
```
And so, the work-flow to run my ""big bang"" (e.g. create.yml) is a 3-liner:
```bash
ansible-playbook prerequisites.yml
ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements -p roles/
ansible-playbook create.yml -i <path_to_inventory>
```
You could, of course, wrap the above 3-liner in a `create.sh` shell script for convenience. This method has served me well for some fairly complex playbook projects that depend on other playbook projects. This forces us to keep roles and playbooks fairly self-contained and re-usable and factor variables out into their own inventory projects. When performed with discipline, it makes it really easy to migrate unaltered roles/playbooks to other environments, then just update inventory variables that are unique to that environment.
**This doesn't solve the conditional import problem**, mind you, but does help me use the `import_playbook` statement for something that may not exist just yet. It kind of gets around a conditional in my very specific use-case. I make use of tagging on the `import_playbook` to leverage the command-line `--tags` and `--skip-tags` features if I need scalpel-like precision at run-time. But if you had to make an import decision based on some other conditional logic (e.g., OS family), well, we still need that as a language feature I think. For now, I just handle those cases with sub-playbooks and chain them together ensuring I target the appropriate hosts/groups that should or should not be targeted based on how I've setup my inventory (yes, it can get messy).
This is all pretty wild and requires a high degree if what I commonly refer to as ""4th dimensional thinking"", especially when you consider branches/versions of things and running them from CI/CD platforms like Jenkins or even AWX. But I still find Ansible fascinating and use it daily.
HTH,
Ben"

This is a frustrating ""missing feature"" Since there is no plan to allow for conditional vars_prompt, the only other way to conditionally get user input at start of playbook would be with conditional ""import_playbook"" based on whether a tag was sent in on commandline.
`- import_playbook: playbook_choice_1.yml
when: ""'specific_tag' in ansible_run_tags""`
I understand that we want a playbook to require no user input, but this is just not a realistic scenario. When you have several users of a given playbook, then you need to ask for passwords. The other option is having dozens of ""ansible vault"" files (nightmare), or by implementing hashicorp vault (first get everything working as desired then implement another level of integration)..."

As to options for managing multiple configurations, there is another option in between Ansible vault files and full-blown Hashicorp Vault deployment. I wrote a tool I named ""python_secrets"" and it works well with Ansible to manage multiple sets of variables outside of a Git repository (including one with Ansible playbooks). I document how to use it this way and have described it in several public talks listed on my home page (my talk at WSLConf from earlier this month will be added as soon as the videos are released).

We've asked for help repeatedly over the years, as we've all got jobs that distract us from supporting open source software, despite our best efforts and intentions.
I'd like to ask that you pay attention to the tone of your message above. ""Ignoring Windows"" is clearly an untrue statement, given the number of hours I've personally spent, the number of hours @larskanis has spent, the amount of time we've spent providing [automated testing tooling][1] for [Nokogiri on Windows][2], etc., etc.
Windows support in Nokogiri is first class. We provide precompiled DLLs for users who want a fast, simple installation; and we provide support for users who want to compile Nokogiri and libxml using DevKit. Saying that we're ignoring Windows users is absurd and a little insulting.
Currently I'm blocking a release that supports Ruby 2.5 on windows on getting Ruby 2.5 supported in our test pipelines. I accept some fault for not being more transparent about this as the blocking factor. But now I'm trying to make amends by communicating exactly what's going on behind the scenes to properly support you and the platform that you use. Not ignoring you or blaming you, as you claim.
I'm going to lock this issue because I really don't want to do a whole back-and-forth. We'll release support for Ruby 2.5 on Windows as soon as we can, just as we always do, and we appreciate your patience and empathy as we work.

1146,288780107,358122690,None,"@worikgh Is this SilverStripe 4.0?
Lets step through it together :)
`TextField` and `HiddenField` both inherit directly from `FormField`.
[`HiddenField`](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/blob/4.0/src/Forms/HiddenField.php) does not define a constructor, thus uses `FormField`'s directly - ie. `($name, $title, value)` - this is 1. unique identification Name, 2. human Readable Title, 3. a preset Value.
While it is true that `TextField` implements a constructor, it simply extends `FormFields` to add two new parameters - at the _end_ of the list (maximum length and the form it belongs to):
`public function __construct($name, $title = null, $value = '', $maxLength = null, $form = null)`
Once these two extra parameters are set as fields on the object, the parent (ie. `FormField`) constructor is called to exact the same results as that of `HiddenField`.
You can see this here:
https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/blob/4.0/src/Forms/TextField.php#L40
This means that `TextField` also calls `FormField::__construct` with the parameter format `($name, $title, $value)`."

While searching an extension, we also take into account the community inputs like number of downloads, number of ratings and average rating along with the string matching. Among the string matching, exact string matches carry a higher weight than prefix match. Since `node_modules` is one word in your extension name, word `node` in search text gets prefix match here. However, there are lot of extensions on Marketplace which have exact word 'node' in their extension name. So they carry a higher weight for matching the word 'node'. Additionally, since your extension is new, download count and ratings of other extensions are way higher, pushing their total score to the top.
One way to improve your extension rank is to break word `node_modules` into separate words `node modules`. This will increase the string matching score and push your extension up in the result."

If I had to guess what's wrong with your approach I'd say:
- Lack of stopwords, kind of meaningless keywords like ""vscode"" or ""in"" are given too much weight.
- Poor query parsing, if keywords are joined in some sort or another the whole thing falls apart (vscode-foo-bar, foo_bar, GitLens etc.)
- Maybe you're giving too much weight to downloads and ratings, the first thing to sort for is relevancy.
> One way to improve your extension rank is to break word node_modules into separate words node modules. This will increase the string matching score and push your extension up in the result.
I'm not going to rename the extension to something wrong (`node_modules` is a folder, I'm not talking about `node modules`, as in ""NPM packages"", here) just to work around this."

Trustcode odo snippets and kvlang is above docker linter, despite having 47k less installs
Python paste and indent has 3 stars but apparently it's 2k extra downloads trumps Python (pydev)'s 5 star rating. Seems like download count is weighted more heavily than rating in the ranking (or maybe python paste and indent has better keywords)
Python Coding Conventions has 773 downloads and is unrated, yet somehow is above magicpython (with 742 _thousand_ downloads and 3.5 stars) and several other extensions with far more downloads / good ratings. So you could have a very popular or well-rated extension but if you don't have the right keywords you will still be ranked down.

Yeah that's another major problem, one could automatically push a new update every day and downloads will go through the roof even though the same number of people are using it.
I guess technically those users are _downloading_ the update, but once this things are counted the downloads counter becomes less meaningful.

- Sometimes if I type `open in browsers` and then hit enter the query becomes `open in browser`, deleting the last character 🤷‍♂️.
- The marketplace doesn't search automatically until I hit enter, _unless_ I delete the query, IMHO that's pretty confusing (and that's also not what's happening in the homepage).
- If I clear the input field then the cursor disappears for a while until the results are returned.
- There's probably no need to wait for those results to be returned in the first place, the top 55 extensions by downloads won't change very often, I'd just cache them (refreshing the cache once a day or so) and just ship them along with the rest of the page to the browser."

Earlier gaurav42 said that ""While searching an extension, we also take into account the community inputs like number of downloads, number of ratings and average rating along with the string matching"". However, when I search for ""python"" ""python extended"" is above my extension despite having literally 0 reviews. In terms of download count we are very close (130k vs. 150k) so if the reviews were taken into account I would expect AREPL to be ranked higher. I would even go so far as to say that reviews should be _more_ important than download count in influencing search ranking (assuming you have enough reviews to be statistically valid). As a user when I search for things I want to find the best extensions, not the most downloaded extensions, but my extension has good reviews so I am biased on that front :P

The ""Line endings"" search seems to be fixed so I'm pretty happy about that.
After a few searches I do agree with @Almenon the search is sadly still pretty broken.
**For me, the biggest issue is its unclear why it is broken (both three months ago, and now)**
Is there some kind of AI returning the results? A handcrafted weighting system? Some transparency about how the search works would go a long way.
I know the code probably can't be made open source, but if the marketplace team made an API that would allow for exact-name matches and regex matches I'm pretty confident the VS Code community could fix this permanently within 48 hours.
Here's an example of the search still being pretty messed up. It's an improvement from last time; at least the relevant results are somewhere in the top 10, and the other results are popular. But on the other hand it is pretty sad that most students in my undergrad Info Storage and Retrieval class wrote better ranking systems in less than a month.

1188,294122809,487866155,None,"@octref Thanks for consolidating already (I was planning to do it this week). These issues were already raised with Marketplace team and here is their explanation
### Searching by id: `GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github-insiders`
We don’t support search on id of the extension(Not supported in SqlFTS too). When we search for GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github-insiders, then we search for two words “GitHub” and “vscode-pull-request-github-inside”. That’s why all the extension’s containing Github are coming at the TOP and results are looking better than SqlFTS.
**Tip**: You can search by extension id using the phrase `@id:GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github-insiders`. Issue: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/69350. Let's track it there.
### Searching by publisher id: `dias`
Azure search provides us custom analyzer to control search relevance. We had done stemming during indexing. So when user searches for “dias”, it returns all the extensions containing “dia” or “dias” both. Here DialogScript is coming at the top, because it contains “dia” , while “dias” is matched in publisher display name of “Open Folder Context Menus for VS Code” extension. Extension display name prefix match has more weight than publisher display name. That’s why “DialogScript” is coming at the top.
We have fixed this issue. We are not doing stemming now. So if you will search for “dias”, it will return the extension’s containing “dias” only.
**Tip**: You can search by publisher using the phrase `publisher:""Pine Wu""`. You can also click on Publisher name in the extension editor. I think this is a good solution for searching by publisher.
### Vue
We do have weights on tags too, but it’s very less (1/100) in compare to extension’s display name. That’s why Vetur extension’s is not coming at the top, when user searches for ‘Vue’. ‘Vue’ search term is a special case, where we expect Vetur extension as top result, because it’s a popular extension of ‘Vue’ language. We were unbale to solve this problem using SqlFTS, but we can solve this using AzureSearch. We can add Synonym Maps property to the index field definition in AzureSearch.
@kesane-msft Please add any details if missing. After consolidating, one of the improvements we would like to see from you is with respect to `vue` phrase in which case giving weightage to tags might help."

Bug
**What is the current behavior?**
If I run .save on a mongoose schema without being connected to the database, the callback is never called. I don't get any errors either. The process seems to be running forever. Also, if I'd run an empty .save(), `message.save()` before the actual save, I get the 200 response back. Not sure if that's the expected behaviour or not.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**

var message = new Message({
content: ""Much content""
});
});
// message.save(); <--- run this to get the 200 response
message.save(function (err) {
if (err){
console.log('Something went wrong: ' + err);
return res.status(500).send(""Something went wrong: "" + err);
}
return res.status(200).send(""Saved!"");
});
```
Model:
```
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Schema = mongoose.Schema;
// Schema.set('validateBeforeSave', false); // to validate data manually
//mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/userFeedback'); <--- don't connect to database
mongoose.set('debug', true);
var MessageSchema = new Schema({
content: String
});
module.exports = mongoose.model('Message', MessageSchema);

1227,304422453,304422453,None,"Hi,
Jekyll syntax highlighting is broken with Twig. Consider the following code block containing a perfectly valid Twig syntax:
```
{% highlight twig %}
{% raw %}
{% set a = 'b' %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
```
It outputs the following HTML:
```
<code class=""language-twig"" data-lang=""twig"">
<span class=""cp"">{%</span> <span class=""k"">set</span> <span class=""nv"">a</span> <span class=""err"">=</span>
<span class=""s1"">'b'</span> <span class=""cp"">%}</span>
</code>
```
Notice the **err** class attributed to the equal sign.

1255,305129827,305129827,None,"This patch accommodates some breaking changes introduced with MySQL 8.
Closes #1959 In a nutshell, the `caching_sha2_password` plugin (which is used by default since MySQL 8.0.4) hashes the password using SHA-256 and, after a first successful authentication attempt, saves it in a cache. That first attempt needs to be done under one of two conditions. The client either uses SSL and sends the password as clear text or it encrypts the password using the RSA public key generated by the server. On any subsequent attempt, until the password is somehow removed from the cache or the server shuts down, these rules no longer apply.
The handshake process remains unchanged when connecting to any server with version lower or equal to `8.0.3`. Whereas for `8.0.4` or above, the process is now the following:
- the client sends a `ClientAuthenticationPacket` with a scramble computed using a SHA-256 hash
- if the password is not cached, the server sends back a `PerformFullAuthenticationPacket`
- if the client uses SSL, the password is sent to the server (as clear text) via a `ClearTextPasswordPacket` to which the server replies with a `OkPacket`
- otherwise it uses the server authentication public key compute the scramble, sending a `AuthSwitchResponsePacket` to which the server replies with a `OkPacket`
- if the client does not know the server public key (is not provided by the user), it requests it from the server, which sends it back using a `AuthMoreDataPacket`
- after a first successful authentication attempt, and until the password is cached, the server will reply to the initial `ClientAuthenticationPacket` with a `FastAuthSuccessPacket` (which basically just signals that an `OkPacket` will follow)
If the account is created using the `mysql_native_password` authentication plugin, the client will just fall back to the ""traditional"" process during the handshake, keeping compatibility, by default for any previously supported server version.
MySQL 8.0.2 disables the `local_infile` server variable by default, which breaks a couple of integration tests. The tests were updated to enable the feature by themselves (something that does not have any effect on older server versions and allows the tests to pass with newer versions).
Additionally, one of the integration tests was updated to avoid failing after the first run (using any server version) since it tried to create a table that already existed from the previous runs."

Being a widely-used base driver we try to support as many Node.js and MySQL versions as possible at once to make it easy to use for everyone.
- [ ] There may not be enough coverage of the new code added, as the coverage with the PR is decreasing. There are probably some areas that can use tests.
- [ ] MySQL 8 image needs to be stood up on the CI server to test against. This is done in the `.travis.yml` file similar to our current MySQL / MariaDB matrix."
1257,305129827,373139995,None,"To address your points.
Regarding the first one, I've missed those tests (sorry), but as far as I can tell there is no sane way to use RSA public key encryption on `node <=v0.12.0`. There are some packages on npm that try to add support through native addons, but I think that might not be a good idea here, since it's pure JavaScript. So the only easy way to work around that is to require users on those older `node` versions to use SSL when connecting to new MySQL versions. If you are OK with that, we can go that route, otherwise, going in the next major version is probably the best possibility (I guess that's mostly your call).
Missed the coverage as well, I'll try to fix that ASAP.
Again, missed the CI config. Should be fine, at least on Travis. However, besides that, I suggest we also create a test account to run the tests (besides `root`) to make sure the handshake works fine for both empty and non-empty passwords, which lead to different behaviors. Any issue with that? Other than that, I guess on windows we are out of luck anyway since appveyor only seems to support MySQL 5.7, correct?"

Ah, very sad :( Did you do a through search on this (it sounds like it)? Because I can always help if you want to focus on the other parts, but just asking before I duplicate the search for no reason. If we really have to drop supported versions, we can, and it wouldn't particularly delay this, just wanted to make sure it was actually required to do so before saying we should :)

Yea, so in Travis CI it just uses a Docker image. You can make multiple non-root accounts too; the current setup was just what was needed for testing, so if MySQL 8 requires more elaborate setup, that sounds fine to me. I would ignore AppVeyor."
1259,305129827,373422784,None,"I'm using `crypto.publicEncrypt()` which was added in `v0.11.14`, and it uses native bindings which I assume were also added around that time. There are some libraries on npm (e.g. [ursa](https://github.com/JoshKaufman/ursa) and [dcrypt](https://github.com/dekz/dcrypt)) that claim support for earlier node versions, however they seem to implement their own native bindings, which I guess would, sort of, defeat the purpose of this module (or maybe not, you tell me).
There's this [node-rsa](https://github.com/rzcoder/node-rsa) thingy which apparently is pure JS, but I couldn't make it work and it's pretty slow. I've also seen other [approaches](https://github.com/ragnar-johannsson/rsautl) like delegating work to openssl via a child process, but that's probably not a good idea either, since it introduces a huge moving part. There's also this [forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) kit which brings the entire browser kitchen sink with it and I also haven't managed to figure out how it worked.
In any case, most of these things, when they work, it's usually on node `>=v0.10`, and I guess this module is supposed to support at least `v0.6`. So, no good news from my side. However, if you can do your own research, that would, of course, be great. I'm not a cryptography expert, but from what I can tell, the reason I have not found anything good is because this RSA thingy in pure JavaScript is still not really feasible (`number` precision, primes and what not).
My suggestion here is to fail with a client error (the `HANDSHAKE_SECURE_TRANSPORT_REQUIRED` introduced by this PR) when `process.env.version` tells us that we are below `v0.11.14`, which basically would be the default behavior using `{ ssl: false, secureAuth: false }`. It's a pretty naive solution but at least it's not really a breaking change, because existing implementations will keep working as expected with MySQL 5.7 and, let's be honest, people wo don't upgrade from those ancient node versions will, almost for sure, not upgrade MySQL to series 8 as well.
However, if you still feel you are better off bumping the major version, that's fine."

1262,305129827,383171533,None,"Ok. Just to be sure, are you talking about sniffing the Node.js version string, MySQL version string, or both? Because we have two different issues right now. Supporting MySQL 8.0.4 (previous DMR release) which expects the password to be encrypted with the server public key using `RSA_PKCS1_PADDING`, whereas since 8.0.11 (the new GA release), the encryption should use `RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING`. We can always retry the handshake, but the only way to avoid that is by ""sniffing"" the MySQL server version.
Regarding the Node.js encryption APIs, I guess we can always resort to duck typing to check if they are available (or not) instead of sniffing the version. So, no problem here.

1264,305129827,383208410,None,"The case where we might need to sniff the server version is to distinguish MySQL 8.0.10 (pre GA, first one introduced chaching_sha1_passwors) from MySQL 8.0.11 (GA). since 8.0.11 was released yesterday one also could not support 8.0.10, as nobody should be using that RC anyways.

1265,305129827,383210478,None,"Right. However, in this case we would be sort of ""whitelisting"" MySQL 8.0.4 specifically. I don't think MariaDB has this new authentication plugin (enabled by default or not), but I'm not entirely sure.
In any case, I believe the padding mode was probably a mistake, which was ""fixed"" for GA. So we can just default to `RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING` (the new 8.0.11 GA version) and optionally do a handshake retry for the specific case where `RSA_PKCS1_PADDING` is needed (MySQL 8.0.4 RC only). Or we can just simply ignore the RC version entirely, like @johannes suggested, by always using `RSA_PKCS1_OAEP_PADDING`.

The new default authentication plugin is more secure because it's using SHA256 instead of SHA1 to hash the password, but it's not available for MySQL versions below 8.0, which means most existing MySQL production instances are not using it as well.

I don't know if it is a good practice or not, it mostly depends on your internal policies and processes (and how much you would be ""trusting"" the fork in this case), but you can install and link npm packages from a git repo even using a specific branch or commit.

I am writing a radsec proxy in go. When I created the topology shown above, everything works fine below v3.0.7 but post 3.0.7 radtest fails with:
```
radclient: Received reply to request we did not send. (id=119 socket3)
```
The `id` and `socket` number are printed the same as the request. Debugger shows that in the scenario above when it reaches the end of [`fr_packet_cmp`](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/release_3_0_16/src/lib/packet.c#L79) the `dst` ports are different (`b->dst_port` is 1812 and the `a->dst_port` is some random number which corresponds to _none_ of the ports shown in the diagram above).
git bisect traced the issue down to commit e4eca2dab. It looks like the code used to set the reply port in case of `server_port > 0`, but after the commit started doing that only for TCP connections. From the commit log it looks like the intent was to reset just the source IP for TCP, but I'm not sure if not setting the _port_ as well was an unintended consequence or not.
(All versions compiled with `--with-udpfromto`)"
1291,307906799,375688619,None,"That's weird. The code *should* set `packet->src/dst` properly.
In the end, I think the correct thing is to have the src/dst ip/port set in `fr_packet_list_recv()`, which solves the issue of having radclient track it. I'll push some fixes. Please test and verify that they work."
1292,307906799,375709048,None,"The other thing is that I'm *highly* suspicious that radclient can break. It's used by everyone for everything.
Further, the `fr_packet_list_find_byreply()` already sets the src/dst ip/port as appropriate. So nothing should be necessary.
I've pushed some cleanups. They work for me. But then, radclient always worked for me."
1293,307906799,375734789,None,"> AFAIU, the proxy itself should not need to rewrite any RADIUS attributes (it should not need to know the shared secret).
That might work... but likely not. The packets are signed with the shared secret. The User-Password attribute (among others) is encrypted with the shared secret."
1294,307906799,375780405,Entitlement,"> Usually, when waiting for a UDP reply the src port isn't taken into consideration. That's not how 99% of UDP protocols work. And definitely not how RADIUS works. This is all documented in RFC 2865.

That's how RADIUS works. This is also clear in RFC 2865. Nothing was changed in later RFCs.
Your proxy might work for one RADIUS client. It definitely won't work for multiple RADIUS clients. Or, it will, but they all have to use the same shared secret.
RFC 2865 explains that you find the shared secret by looking up the source IP of the packet. This means that all downstream servers will look up *your* proxy IP to get *one* shared secret. If the originating UDP clients use *multiple* shared secrets, it won't work.
And no, you can't change shared secrets per packet. And no, you can't change shared secrets per destination.
If you want to learn other UDP to TCP proxy issues, read RFC 6613. It explains all of these issues in excruciating detail.
TBH, you can't just write a ""UDP to TCP"" translator for RADIUS and expect it to work. You MUST implement the RADIUS protocol correctly. This involves reading, and following, the RFCs.
Any short-cut you take means that you have a toy implementation. It might work for simple tests, but it will fall over and die in any real-world environment."
1295,307906799,375787025,Mocking,"So you admit that your implementation is wrong.
The *UDP* RADIUS clients will not have that shared secret. So simply taking UDP packets *as-is* and dropping them into a TCP / TLS connection will violate RFC 6614.

This is projecting.
The *engineering* point (not an emotional one) is that you MUST read the specs and follow them. Taking short-cuts, and then *arguing* when told those short-cuts are wrong is simply the wrong thing to do."

---
Anything with a heavy component of red or blue is harder to read. The human eye has the fewest cones (the elements of our eyes that see color) for red, followed by blue, and the most for green. So that orange — no matter the shade — is taxing to read, even for people with good eyesight. Factor in people with vision disabilities, or even just people getting older; and any shade of orange is going to feel downright hostel

In the case of PR #7551, the brighter orange (`#FF8300`) proposed passes in all cases, and the darker orange (`#E34C00`) doesn't pass the WCAG AAA for normal texts case.
Arduino users have grown to instantly spot orange as error messages, and I think it's appropriate to keep it so as to not break UX and, IMO, it's is the best color for representing errors in a black background after red.

@jockm I wasn't talking about the code. I was talking about standard output in the console. It seems you are missing the fact that the console may display more than only warnings and errors. Standard output has always been printed in white text in the console. Warnings and error messages have always been printed in red. The difference in colors allows us to quickly notice the critical parts of the output. If you make standard output and error/warning text both white that means I need to read the entire output to find a warning or error message.

That is a broken UX
By all means, make errors visually distinct.

I do not think this is a good idea. The text that is currently printed in a distinct color, is the text that was printed on the ""stderr"" output of subprocesses. Typically, this contains errors, but this is not necessarily so. For the compiler, it is also used for warnings. Avrdude even prints all of its verbose output to stderr. Prefixing each line with ""ERROR"" or something similar would probably only confuse users. More correct would be to prefix each line with ""stdout"" or ""stderr"", but that would still confuse novice users who have no clue what these terms mean.
The current approach of using a different color seems to bypass this problem by not explicitly stating what the colored text means, it just draws more attention to it.
As for using a different color to improve readability: That seems like a viable option to me. Of course, using a red or red-ish color for errors (and some other stuff, as pointed out above) seems common, which is probably why it is done now. Using e.g. green would also draw attention to the text, but I *think* users would not expect green text to contain error messages, so it might be better to consider other colors. @tofrnr also suggested a yellow color, which could work IMHO.
As for making things bold: I'm not sure if that would stand out sufficiently, but that might just need an experiment perhaps?"

What I was implying was that there would be some parsing of the text to inject ""Error:"" before error messages, and maybe ""Warning:"" before warning, etc. I am sorry if I wasn't more clear.
> The current approach of using a different color seems to bypass this problem by not explicitly stating what the colored text means, it just draws more attention to it.
And yet I can point to people who are having trouble reading the error text, and have already pointed to two sources that say color is bad when the goal is readability — and error messages are already hard to read if in white.
We have no data on how many people care about colors vis-a-vis branding, have problems with them, or who do have problems with them. Nor is there a good feedback mechanism for the average user to use.
Don't we want to make the Arduino IDE as easy to use for the greatest number of people as possible? This includes making it as accessible as possible. So until and unless there is a theme editor that is directly part of the Arduino IDE along with a set of themes; what is the harm in making errors _more_ readable?"

The problem there is that it is hard to reliably decide whether something is an error, warning, etc. Hardcoding regexes might work for (certain versions of) gcc, but third-party cores can also use different compilers and tools. Making these regexes configurable per core/board would be the correct approach to this, but also a *lot* more work.

I was not trying to say that the current approach is free of any problems, I'm just saying that using color to distinguish between stdout and stderr does not have the problem of labeling all stderr output explictly as ""error""."

Then it could be something other than ""error"". I mean it would be wrong to use ""stderr"", but it could be anything. As an off of the top of my head suggestion ""Important:""?

It is not possible that in all these years you have not fixed this that is really the ONE SINGLE thing that is NOT OK in the standard interface.
It is really BAD that there is not a simple setting to change the error color (say to white - there is already the ORANGE bar when there are errors, maybe you may put one red square char at line start if you want to permanently mark in some ways the error, no matter the color the end user chooses).

No need to become personal, especially not dissing ""volunteering efforts"" in any Open Source project.
I meant it is much more relevant to us as in no-one else (apart from other version control software or services, like git or GitHub) deals with the one question which none of the official pages deal with: how to deal with user contributions that are intrinsic to the software.
> Instead of simply fixing the software.
If anyone of us would know what is needed to fix the software, we would do it. Can you point out what needs fixing? I don't think that is possible, most certainly not ""simple"".
I have the feeling no-one really understands any specifics about GDPR (and that includes the big guys like Google and Facebook). I think the majority of what's out there is misinformation.
I like how OpenStreetMap (who ""have received professional counsel"") say in their paper:
> Naturally estimating the impact of the GDPR introduction and consequences before it is
actually in force are fraught with the problem that we have to guess how the legislation will
be applied in practice and there is a danger of both over- and underreacting."
1373,315863357,392736227,None,"Changing `DOKU_PREFS` into a session does not fix anything but breaks the usability imho. `DOKU_PREFS` is used e.g. for storing the size of the edit window and this should persist across sessions imho. As Anika says, cookies do not store the IP (or even DNS entry) of the user, the IP address is instead sent with every request.
Not storing IP addresses is also not the solution as there is a very valid reason to store them at least temporarily: detect and remove vandalism (by IP address you can identify the connection between several edits, possibly even several user accounts) and to be able to identify the author (at least in court) if the content posted was illegal and the site owner gets sued because of that.
What I think would be a good thing is to have some automatic way to remove IP addresses after some time, at least for changes where the user has been logged in (this could be a plugin of course). For anonymous edits I'm not sure if the IP address can be interpreted as an author identification that needs to be stored because of the license (but this of course depends on the selected license).
Concerning the removal of the user name: my personal (non-lawyer) interpretation is that due to the license of the content (creative commons license at least with attribution), DokuWiki has a legitimate interest to store this attribution as it otherwise cannot use the content and as the Wikimedia issue tracker says ""the right of erasure only exists when the processing is not necessary for some legitimate interest of the data controller""."
1374,315863357,392738048,Bitter frustration,"Thanks @michitux for pointing out the usability aspects. I was just about to do that.
@selfthinker thanks for the links on how other wikis handle it. I'll have a look later.
Regarding removing IP addresses after while, there is now the aptly named gdpr plugin which does exactly that. It also replaces user names in change logs for deleted users.
I will close this ticket now. We will probably not ever get definite answers to all the questions asked in the original issue. And it's an issue people love to discuss for the sake of discussing without getting any further.
For now we should simply focus on having a useful privacy policy for the 0.1 percent of users who care about that. So please, if you think the privacy policy needs adjustments just go ahead and do it."
1375,315863357,392738379,Insulting,"> I don't think this specific cookie comes with IP address and DNS entry attached. That cookie and its contents is not stored on the server but only in the browser.
It's the very nature of any cookie to come with IP address or DNS records attached. All of them are stored in the browser, only. Still GDPR considers them to be personal data, which is why they have to become session cookies or ask for user content before being placed. Fairly simple basics.
> If anyone of us would know what is needed to fix the software, we would do it.
Code is provided above. Instead of looking at the code and commenting it, all the extensive comments sum up to ""Go away, we have to find a harder way"".
Very apparently, some people here *want* to stick their head in the sand. Instead of applying these patches and enjoying a GDPR compliant wiki. Enjoy it!
And I just see how you closed the issue to make extra sure nobody sees this solution. Extra compliment to that much stupidity!"
1376,315863357,392738963,None,"> would it be desirable to extend that with technology (eg. automatically list what data is collected when, why and how long) and provide a way for plugins to hook into that?
I would definitely say Yes to that. That should also include templates, not just plugins. (I know e.g. some templates include Google Analytics.) Maybe have a hook per section (cookies, third party, etc)?"
1377,315863357,392741148,None,"> GDPR considers [cookies] to be personal data
That is simply factually not true. The [official original legal text](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679) says only one thing about cookies:
> (30) Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them.
This means that cookies only need to be considered **if** they contain personal data or can be used to obtain them in any way. That is not the case with `DOKU_PREFS`."
1378,315863357,392742576,None,"This topic is now locked. @Traumflug that kind of language is not welcome here
To clarify some last points:
* the GDPR is only about Personal Data. Cookies are not per se personal data (they might be if they can be used to identify people - the doku_prefs cookie does not)
* cookies do not ""come with IP address or DNS records attached"" that is technically nonsense. Cookies are sent back by the browser when the domain they are saved for matches
* The IP address of the originating request is always visible to the server. That's how TCP/IP works and nothing to do with cookies or anything
* There is legitimate reason to save the IP addresses for a certain amount of time to react on malicious activity
* making doku_prefs a session cookie makes the UX of the application much worse without improving privacy at all
* if you want code to be discussed for integration into DokuWiki core, open a proper pull request"
1379,320553214,320553214,Impatience,"Balancing artillery
I'd like to get the stuff I've already tested out of the way. The current balance team is essentially doing everything I already did in terms of making balance changes and testing them.
A lot of time is being wasted doing what I've already done. I've tested my changes in hundreds of matches with great feedback. The only negative opinions I get are from trolls or people who need an excuse for why they suck at the game.
So, first up, ARTILLERY.
These values allow the artillery to remain effective, but not overpowered. Instead of 3 arty destroying a huge infantry blob, you'll 4-6 of them.
Damage vs vehicles has been buffed slightly to compensate for lack of infantry killing.
A direct hit will kill the infantry, but if it lands off to the side, it can take anywhere from 1-4 shots. With a small group of artillery firing, the aoe will make it a lot more effective.
Cost also went up, and it's speed has been slowed down. I think I buffed it vs buildings too, maybe not.
Now, the artillery infantry tradeoff is fair, and for what it lacks in anti infantry, it makes up for by doing roughly 10-20% more dmg to everything else.

That just misleads people and they don't understand what is going on, hence the fix. Salt SSH still needs to have both library sets (dependencies) on the Master for the specific Python versions, so the `.tar.gz` is carrying over those in `py<major version>` subdirectories.
@dincamihai NOTE: actually if you are running Salt on a Master from the specific version, you _do not_ need to install Salt again for the alternative version, as it is anyway works for both versions. This is just packaging convenience. But in fact you need only couple of version-specific libraries to be installed so they will be picked up by the `thin` creation procedure.

Your example seems to remove some of the useful information and has this ""on a Master"" that I don't understand. Is that intended or should it be ""on the Master""?

1424,330697632,396246513,None,"OK, as per speaking with @dincamihai it would be also an option to:
- Add all the options into the documentation.
- Add short minimally intrusive to the target machine option (i.e. update the SaltSSH side w/o touching the target)
That said, CLI would return something like:
```
The ""my-to-be-minion.greatdomain.com"" machine is running Python 2.6 version.
Please install Salt for 2.6 Python on the Salt SSH machine and set it up.
```
or:
```
The ""my-to-be-minion.greatdomain.com"" machine is running Python 2.7 version.
Please install Salt for 2.7 Python on the Salt SSH machine.
```
So such info on the CLI would suggest what to do now, quickly and easiest way. And the following would go to the documentation (rephrased into more extended version):
""Depending on the Python version on the target, you need to install Python2.7 compatible salt on origin to add support for Python2.7 targets or install Python2.6 compatible salt on origin to add support for Python2.6 targets or upgrade to Python==3.x on target"""

- update the one client that doesn't work

No, I don't think spending some personal time investigating a problem you have with a software you got from me for free is ""rude"".
I've pointed out your mistake and you are perfectly capable of spotting the difference between the original configuration that was working and you've commented out and the one you've changed and that don't.
From the `gatling.conf` in the sample you've provided (L217):

> I let Gatling community know that Gatling exhibits strange behavior in the presence of other libraries
That's mostly likely an invalid statement, as:
1) your sample works, at least on my side
2) the library you're mentioning, `io.kubernetes:client-java`, is built on top of Square's okhttp and doesn't share any dependency with Gatling which is built on top of Netty.

Let's agree that we disagree and that nothing good will come from this discussion.

Your choice of words is not very accurate. You didn't try to reproduce this issue. Your reasoning is on point though - outlined configuration is much too complex and has only started failing after certain tests were added (added tests run 100% fine, but others don't and the whole thing freezes)."

Then it doesn't really sound like it belongs as an issue here. We want to keep this space clear for bugs and issues in Jasmine itself.
I would also urge you to be careful and considerate when telling others what they have and haven't done. We've invested a significant amount of time in trying to eliminate various timing issues with Jasmine, but this one seems to come primarily from the suite being executed.
Thanks for using Jasmine!"

Any PHONG material (Diffuse + Specular + Normal) exported or converted to GLTF gives wrong results.

> > The last thing to do is setting renderer.gammaOutput = true.

This is a deliberate decision and not a bug. Base color and emissive textures in glTF (and, typically, diffuse textures in any format...) are in sRGB colorspace. GLTFLoader marks them as such (`material.map.encoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding`), so that they're converted to linear colorspace for correct PBR lighting calculations. Finally colors should be converted back to sRGB (e.g. `renderer.gammaOutput=true`).
If you skip all of this, with any format, lighting calculations are incorrect. SEA3DLoader, FBXLoader, and ColladaLoader never touch the `.encoding` property of any texture, and leave it to the end user to change texture colorspace and renderer colorspace. I'm pretty confident that the large majority of three.js users are passing sRGB colors into three.js without converting, despite the fact that renderer lighting calculations assume linear colorspace, and getting results that are ""good enough"" but inconsistent with other engines and authoring environments. For correct results you should be using `renderer.gammaOutput=true`, and marking sRGB textures as sRGB.
None of these issue are specific to glTF (see https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/11337), but with GLTFLoader we're trying to achieve consistency with other engines and 3D authoring environments, and have chosen to treat all sRGB textures as sRGB for a first step. If you're mixing models from other formats in the scene, then yes it's awkward, and you'd need to either mark the diffuse textures of those formats as sRGB or mark the colorspace on the glTF models to linear (the latter is incorrect for all model formats involved, but may look good enough if you don't need precise colors).

Ricardo,
PHONG looks great with Diffuse + Specular only.
PBR does not look great with BaseColor + MetallicRoughness only.
That's the main problem here.
The Normal/Bump and Environment textures are irrelevant at this point.
On top of that: more texture layers = bigger file size and performances drop

Being able to author a PBR model in Substance Painter or download one from Sketchfab, and have the model appear as the artist designed it, is good for three.js users. I don't think there's any definition of ""best result"" where that sort of consistency can be dismissed.
> This topic shows GLTFLoader design flaws. We don't reinvent the wheel here, so ""renderer.gammaOutput = true"" is not an option now...
This isn't reinventing any wheels, and it isn't a design flaw. PBR calculations are done in linear space, with every engine I'm aware of. If you pass sRGB data into the renderer and pretend it's linear, the lighting and blending math will come out wrong. The difference is not huge, and so this not a major concern for many three.js users, but nevertheless it is not as good as it could be. For that reason, your ""good"" result example is not actually correct. But as you've said before, backward-compatibility is important, so I'm not here to advocate for changing any three.js defaults. But because glTF is a new format, and because we're trying to get PBR right, we're going to mark sRGB textures as sRGB, even if other loaders are not doing so.
See [this article about Unreal](http://artbyplunkett.com/Unreal/unrealgamma.html) — > ...textures that are used for color information should have the sRGB flag checked, and textures that are used for masks and numerical calculations in shaders and effects (like Normal maps) should have it unchecked. And if you follow this simple guideline you mostly get the best effect.

> ...should other loaders be doing so? It seems like this inconsistency between loaders is a point of confusion for users, and it would make sense for all of them to treat sRGB textures the same way if possible.
If we had a time machine, yes, the other loaders should also be marking sRGB textures containing color data as sRGB. But making the change now would cause confusion and break backward-compatibility, and the `gammaOutput=true` setting needed to fix output is not intuitive — I don't think changing other loaders can be justified given those issues.
Let's keep an eye on https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/11337. I hope the resolution there will make color workflows more intuitive. With that and NodeMaterial, there may be opportunities to fix some existing issues without breaking anyone's existing applications."

fbx.animations; // Array<THREE.AnimationClip>
fbx.models; // Array <THREE.Group, THREE.Mesh, THREE.SkinnedMesh>

Errr.... this is extremely fuzzy. `GLTFLoader` appears to be a community provided example, that lives in `/examples`. If you load three.js alone (`three.min.js`) there wont be any mention of GLTF.
If you use three.js off the shelf you get a scenegraph and various webgl abstractions. In this context, GLTF is just another one of many many examples of how you can translate some generic 3d data / scene file into three.js's structs. So, at a glance, three.js seems like this generic library, that draws stuff to screen. It doesn't care if you fetch that data from some remote server, and it doesn't care how you parse it (collada, fbx, sea3d, gltf... and 40 others). At the end of the day, you are rendering a `THREE.Mesh` with `THREE.Geometry` and `THREE.Material`. **Absolutely all of the loaders share this feature. All of them result in this data structure.**
However, in practice, this is not the case, and you seem to be in the right. GLTF is a ""first class citizen"" of three.js. @mrdoob wrote that several times. SEA3d is some **random format** written by **some unknown people** while GLTF has the backing of THE khronos group. On top of that, it's probably meant to be the backbone of the whole VR/AR revolution, hence so much backing by other big players. This is just an unfortunate circumstance that three.js found itself in as the most widely used webgl library. People want to do 3d, which three.js solves really well with it's scene graph and other abstractions (things like `Mesh`, `Geometry`, `Material`, `Texture` etc.). Unfortunately, people also want to make experiences and expect three.js to be able to do that. This is of course complicated, hence, favoring one particular format and giving it preferential treatment makes sense. It may somewhat hurt the very essence of the library (draw stuff on screen) but it's a trade off. If you care to read all the guidelines, there's a document called [owners](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Owners). @donmccurdy owns that particular loader, so his word carries as much weight as @mrdoob's, so good luck there :)
The directive right now is:
>three.js must support gltf
So anything that the khronos group comes up with has to be reflected in three.js. If you look at the discussion historically, @mrdoob doesn't really follow what's going on and @donmccurdy is the authority on all things khronos/gltf related.
So for example, khronos has defined a specification for gltf ""extensions"". Out of infinitely many extensions, one involves texture transformations. It has been ratified by the khronos group and because of that, **three.js absolutely must support it**. This warrants a PR with **11 thousands line of code** and increasing the size of the library by 1/3.

Unity has an editor which is a foreign concept for three.js. When you ""load"" a texture into unity, you bring it into the editor which can do all kinds of transformations before actually storing it for game's use. I think that three.js has a different paradigm, since it doesn't care how you create the assets nor how you store them. An analogy would be if three.js came with folder `/utils` and then `/textureTools` or something like that, where you could prepare the assets for three.js. This difference should possibly be considered.

However, @RemusMar has consistently exhibited what can only be described as disruptive behaviour over a long period of time and I don't think that marking comments is going to bring about any kind of change.

https://github.com/eslint/eslint-scope/issues/39
`eslint-scope` 3.7.2 has been published an hour ago which is a hacked version that steals the NPM accounts or something.
Please pull the version 3.7.2 from the npm and freeze the account so this does not get propagated.
As a matter of fact, there is no release tag for 3.7.2 on Github, so I think it would be great to consider double checking with Github repository before publishing any code. This would at least limit the possibility of uploading the malicious code to NPM without having Github credentials to tag the release/version. Additionally I believe it's possible to check if the release was signed and somehow enforce all tagged commits to be signed. I think Github returns such information via their API, at least you can see the verified commits via Github's web interface so there must be a way. Developer may be able to opt-in for this extra security via some `.rc` file stored in Git repo."
1508,340599374,404502145,None,3.7.2 seems to have been unpublished now. Would love to hear what actually happened.
1509,340599374,404507723,None,"@akx shortly, the npm credentials have been stolen and the malicious release has been made directly to npm (not GitHub). The malicious code ran upon `npm install` and attempted to transfer the npm authentication token from `.npmrc` to remote server. Surprisingly, the tampered code only contained a bootstrap script that downloaded and executed the main script (with `eval`) from pastebin and the pastebin script had a syntax error in it so that's how it revealed itself. All of what happened is something to think about, why didn't npm spot the calls to `eval` and reject the update. I know many packers use `eval` as well but come on, it's not 1999 again and there are simple measures and protocols that can be implemented in order to strengthen the security of npm ecosystem."
1510,340599374,404519128,None,"The first question that came to mind after seeing this issue is: why is there a difference between the published code on npm, and the code on github? I know why, because when you run `npm publish`, you publish from a local directory.
I think npm can increase security by **not letting people publish code from their local directories but only download code from a public repo** like github’s (ala server-to-server). It would of course only be possible for public modules/repositories. That way all published code always has a history.
It increases security because to publish malicious code you need to:
1. steal both npm credentials and github credentials
2. commit and push malicious code to github
3. pass security a project's build pipeline (and possible security scans) I'm probably not the first with this idea, but has it been considered by the npm team yet?

1518,340599374,404550816,None,"@EdwardDrapkin Agree with all of your points, but I'd go a step further with number 2: in addition to searching the registry, unpublish all packages published since the affected version was published (and even then, it's not clear yet if the eslint-scope infection was a result of a further upstream infection). The virus could have modified itself (or have been manually modified, or use a different version entirely) so as to be unrecognizable from the original. There's nothing to say that the pastebin code from this incident is the same as what would be infected in other packages of authors with their credentials compromised. The credentials are being logged to web counters, which to use the credentials they would have to be monitored from an outside source, so there's nothing stopping that outside source from publishing a different script entirely.
Edit: upon further thought, I realize that my suggestion should only be done if it is determined that a significant amount of packages are affected after halting all package publications and revoking all tokens. It's possible that could effectively resolve this specific incident. However this should at least be a ""shot across the bow"" that a single token being compromised can have disastrous ripple effects across the ecosystem."

The script seems to have run successfully on one user's Windows system. The ""problem"" in the script seems to have been that it would only run correctly if the full source code was fetched in the first chunk - the malware author forgot to ensure all chunks had been fetched.

Not every npm package uses git, and certainly not everyone uses github. Marrying the two concepts doesn't make sense to me.
I think the best solution is faster communication and awareness of exploited packages. Some brainstorming ideas:
* Maybe integrate the npm ecosystem into something like node security project. Warnings should be shown inside of NPM cli when a vulnerable package is found in the dep tree.
* Easy flagging of infected code to notify maintainers.
* Have stricter publish regimens for foundational (heavily depended on) dependencies. Maybe enforce manual audits with two factor authentication. Realistically dependencies that have thousands and thousands of dependents should not be modified so frequently, or they must go through a manual audit step. * Perhaps have a badge awarded to releases that have been manually audited and approved with a 2 factor verification.

The feature, as described, would also not make CI builds repeatable by default, since that would involve all transitive dependencies having been published with this default, and that would likely take an immense amount of time and never be quite done, considering the scale of the registry, so I don't consider it a very good solution.

1535,347951340,347951340,None,"[I have read the previous stance on the idea of allowing composer to manage multiple versions of a given package.](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/2167) However, I would like to re-open the discussion as there are valid use cases for wanting multiple versions installed in parallel. I would counter that this is completely possible based on the following arguments:
1. It's not composer's responsibility to ensure that a developer doesn't try to do something they aren't supposed to do; mind you, it would be fair of composer to issue a stern warning, but ultimately allow a developer to shoot themselves in the foot if that's what they so choose to do.
1. PHP's namespace aliasing and/or composer's autoloader might be a way to work around loading two classes from different versions of a package -- in other words, manipulate the namespace in the autoloader so that if I install versions `2.0` and `3.0` of `package/xyz` (with a namespace of `Package\Xyz`) I could reference them in code as either `Package\Xyz\2.0\MyClass or `Package\Xyz\3.0\MyClass`. And if I wanted to import both of them, I could alias the second one to a non-conflicting class name (see point 1 above).
1. There are use-cases where packages are installed to be run as commands (e.g., phpunit, pdepend, phpcs, phpdoc, phpstan, et al) and would not be included/required directly into a PHP project's code base
One use case I've run into is that I want to install `ramsey/jenkins-php`, which inheritantly depends on `nikic/php-parser: ^1.0`, as well as `phpstan/phpstan-symfony` which inheritantly depends on `nikic/php-parser: ^4.0`. Both are commands to be run from a shell, so there would be no actual conflict with each other. The only thing stopping them from both being installed side by side is that composer does not support multiple versions of the same library.
I understand that this is probably going to be a decisive feature request. I also understand I've probably not thought out every single possible hurdle to making this happen. But I feel like this is an important request to discuss with you and the composer community.

With non-consumer equipment, Opus has a distinct sonic signature, even where the sampling rate change on encode has been avoided. Plain AAC-LC sounds better to me, and I can differentiate AAC at any bit rate compared to lossless even with most consumer equipment, including mobile devices. Do the highest possible quality 44.1->48 kHz conversion to music I'm familiar with, in hardware or software, and I will still be able to identify it. That Opus does this right off the bat makes it a no-go in my book, and I disagree with their reasoning for it.
ABX listening tests are pointless unless they take into account the intimate familiarity many people have with their music; they rarely do. That's a much longer discussion.
Anyway, use what works for you. Just remember that perceptual coding is generally subjective by nature and not everyone will agree with your likes and dislikes. Especially people that can hear an artifact, identify it, and verify what they're hearing with proper analysis tools, in that order. 😸"

Fraunhofer FDK AAC license (#fdk)
This is a free software license as far as it goes. It is incompatible with any version of the GNU GPL.
It has a special danger in the form of a term expressly stating it does not grant you any patent licenses, with an invitation to buy some. Because of this, and because the license author is a known patent aggressor, we encourage you to be careful about using or redistributing software under this license: you should first consider whether the licensor might aim to lure you into patent infringement. If you conclude that the program is bait for a patent trap, it would be wise to avoid the program.
It is possible that the pertinent patents have expired. Depending on whether Fraunhofer still has active patents covering the work, the software might be a trap now, or not. (Of course, any program is potentially threatened by patents, and the only way to end that is to change patent law to make software safe from patents.)
```
The fdk aac license: https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Fdk
look at point 3, even ffmpeg aac encoder that is lgpl does not explicit says that has no patent grant, but it does not means that it has, the only difference is that GNU FSF does not like Fraunhofer:

1558,349736129,349736129,None,"As a user i want to be able to configure a sender name per email alias so i don't expose my real name for any of my anonymous email addresses.
### Acceptance criteria
- Allow to set a different name for every email alias and the main email address.
- If there is no sender name configured for the used address, the sender name in the email should remain empty (no fallback).
- Sender name is used when writing an email (new email, reply, forward)
- Sender name is used in calendar invites/replies
- Sender name is used in external notification emails
- Sender name is stored encrypted with group key of the mailbox
- Sender name can be modified by the owner (even if non-admin) of the mailbox that the email address is assigned to.
- When creating a user the user name is also used as the sender name of the user's default email address
- When an admin creates an alias for a user (or for themselves), the sender name for the alias can also be specified. The user name is shown in the text field by default.
- When changing the user name or an email address name other names are not changed automatically (user name and email address names are independent)
- Existing sender names are retained (main sender name and user group). All email addresses inherit the configured sender name.
- Users can still log in with aliases
### Implementation hints
- Introduce configuration object per email address (users mail address and email aliases) which holds the name in the first place and later can also have the signature and out of office notification.
- Run a migration on the client that creates the config object and writes existing email addresses with name to it.
- Currently, a non-admin user can't see their aliases or change their sender name. We need to show alias list to all users and not only admins so that they can change their sender name.
GUI: Replace email alias table with new email address table/list were also the users main email address is listed. Show it also for non admin users. Allow specifying name but not activation/deactivation/deletion. One entry in the list should have two rows. First row shows email address, second row status and sender name were status is either ""main address"", ""activated"" or ""deactivated""
## Tasks
- [x] Design and change model
- [x] Add client migration
- [x] Add configuration UI to settings to configure the name per alias
- [x] Allow non-admins to see mail aliases and configure the names for it
- [x] Change the client to use the new model when sending mails/saving drafts
- [x] Make sure that calendar invites include the right name
- [x] Clarify with support/marketing that it behaves like expected
- [x] Change UI for adding alias to allow configuring the name
## Test notes
- [x] Test new model: release new tutadb without schema upgrade and without a new client, test that spam report preference can still be changed
- [x] Test desktop client migration from the previous DB version
Prepare an existing account with admin, local admin and at least two normal users
- [x] Previously unmigrated account, log in, open mail editor. Sender name dropdown should pick up existing sender name
- [x] Go to settings and change sender name for some mail addresses. It should now be used in mail editor
- [x] Check that it is used in calendar event invites
- [x] Check that it is used in external notification emails
- [x] Check that you can add an alias with sender name, it should default to user name
- [x] Check that you can still edit the user name and it doesn't change sender name
- [x] Log in as a global admin, check that your own sender names can be changed via mail or user management settings
- [x] Check that you can view and change previous user's sender names
- [x] Check another user (user B) (who hasn't logged in yet). Should be able to do the same things
- [x] Check that you can add an alias with sender name, it should default to user name
- [x] Log in as a local admin. Check that you can also view and edit things for both users.
- [x] Log in as user B, check that the settings by admins have been applied, you can view and edit sender names
- [x] Check that mail address table shows primary mail address and email aliases and their statuses correctly
- [x] Check that as non-admin you don't see how many aliases you can add nor you can add/remove aliases
- [x] Check that number of available aliases is correctly updated when an alias is added
- [x] Check that as an admin aliases can be enabled/disabled and the status is displayed correctly
- [x] Check that whitelabel aliases can be deleted but not disabled"

This one was towards the ability to set a different ""sender name"" for all the registered e-mail addresses (including aliases). If you go to `Settings > User Management`, there is only one `Sender name`; the value there will be used for all outgoing e-mails, regardless of the alias in use.

A specific example (and compliant with the privacy mindset) would be this - one wants to create an identity which is not real (but sounds legit) for services where one does't feel comfortable sharing and/or is not required to provide a real name, but considers these services legitimate enough that one may want to still preserve some shape of form of an identity, especially when there is an e-mail correspondence (contacting support, sales,...).
In a nutshell, one can still do it, but only via aforementioned account-wide Sender name option in the settings, which I would be genuinely surprised if anyone had it filled in as it would ""sign"" every sent e-mail with that name, which we at that point we all could use just aliases with a standard firstname+surname syntax."

Yes, a user can only configure 1 _**sender name**_ per account (they can change the sender name to what ever they like).
The problem here is that all aliases use the same sender name, we want to assign different _**sender name**_ simultaneously to every _**email aliases**_ created by a single tutanota user.

I ""get"" why this happens in the sense that I think I can explain, with sufficient reference to the arcana in the manual about what introduces scopes and what doesn't, but I think that this is problematic for interactive use.
In example one, you get a silent failure. In example two, you get an error message that is very there-is-no-spoon. Thats roughly comparable to some Python code I wrote in a notebook at work today.
I'm not sure what the rules are in Python, but I do know that generally you can't assign to things at the global scope without invoking global. But at the REPL it does work, presumably because at the REPL the rules are different or the same logic as if they were all are in the scope of function is applied.
I can't language-lawyer the rules enough to propose the concrete change I would like, and based on Slack this isn't even necessarily perceived as an issue by some people, so I don't know where to go with this except to flag it.

It is less of an issue with a lot of Julia code in the wild and in tests, and it did reveal a lot of variables which were accidentally global (in both Julia Base's tests according to the original PR, and I noticed this on most of DiffEq's tests). In most cases it seems that the subtly wrong behavior isn't what you get (expecting a change in a loop), but rather expecting to be able to use a variable in a loop is what I've found to be the vast majority of where this shows up in updating test scripts to v1.0. So the good thing is that in most cases the user is presented with an error, and it's not difficult to fix.
The bad thing is that it's a little verbose to have to put `global x` inside of the loops, and now your REPL code is also different from the function code. Whether or not it's more intuitive behavior than before is a tough opinion because [there were definitely some edge cases in hard/soft local scoping](http://ucidatascienceinitiative.github.io/IntroToJulia/Html/ScopingExperiment) and so this is clearly easier to explain. But at the same time, while having a much more succinct explanation than the behavior of before, it's now easier to hit the edge cases where understanding scoping rules matters. 🤷‍♂️. I for one would like to see the experiments with `let` blocking. This would keep the ""you didn't really want so many globals"" aspect of it, along with the simplified scoping explanation, while at the same time make REPL code behave like function interiors (which is seemingly what we've always wanted). Or inversely, making people specify variables they want to act as globals
```julia
global x = 5
for i = 1:5
println(x+i)
end
```
could be a nice way to keep the explicitness, and would make the ""REPL code is slow because of globals"" be much more obvious. The downside is that once again throwing things into a function would not require the `global` markers. But given how this tends to show up, it's not really gamebreaking or a showstopper. I'd classify it as a wart that should get a mention in any workshop but it's not like v1.0 is unusable because of it. I hope that changing this behavior isn't classified as breaking and require v2.0 though."

To me the REPL not behaving like global scope would be potentially even more confusing than the discrepency that causes this issue.
Regardless, at the very least I think that the documentation should be somewhat more explicit about this issue. Casually reading the docs I would have assumed that you would need to use the `local` keyword to get the behavior occurs in global scope by default."

(I was one of the few people who did give feedback in #19324, though, where I argued [for the old behavior](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/19324#issuecomment-356484761).)
A non-breaking way out of this would be to change back to the old behavior (ideally not by inserting implicit `let` blocks or anything — just restore the old code in `julia-syntax.scm` as an option) in the REPL. Or rather, to make it available in environments like IJulia that might want it, add a `soft_global_scope=false` flag to `include`, `include_string`, and `Core.eval` to restore the old behavior."

Yes, and I greatly appreciate it. It doesn't much matter now since we made the choice, let it bake for ten months and have now released it with a long-term commitment to stability. So the only thing to do now is to focus on what to do going forward.
Having an option to choose between the old behavior and the new one is interesting but it feels very hacky. That means we not only sometimes have a scoping behavior that everyone apparently found incredibly confusing, but we don't always have it and whether we have it or not depends on a global flag.

I actually started looking into implementing something like this a few minutes ago. However, it looks like it would be *much* easier to implement as an option in `julia-syntax.jl`:
* Writing an external AST transformation is possible, but it seems like there are lots of tricky corner cases — you basically have to re-implement the scoping rules — whereas we already had the code to get it right in `julia-syntax.scm`.
* It's even more tricky for something like IJulia that currently uses `include_string` to evaluate a whole block of code and get the value of the last expression. Not only would we have to switch to parsing expression by expression, but some hackery may be needed in order to preserve the original line numbers (for error messages etcetera). (Though I found a [hack for ChangePrecision.jl for this sort of thing](https://github.com/stevengj/ChangePrecision.jl/blob/master/src/ChangePrecision.jl#L105-L111) that may work here also.)
* Not to mention of the case of people that `include` external files, which would not be caught by your AST transformation.

Sorry, but this argument is ridiculous to me. I'm not talking about classes where I'm teaching programming. There's a place for simple interactive computations, and in non-CS classes it's common to be introduced to programming languages as a ""glorified calculator"" to start with. Teaching [performance computing in Julia](https://github.com/stevengj/18S096) is an entirely different process — but it doesn't hurt if they've already been using Julia as their ""calculator.""
If you start by introducing students to Matlab as their ""calculator,"" it's much harder to make the transition to ""real"" programming, because their first instinct is to do as much as possible with Matlab before jumping ship, at which point their bad habits are ingrained and they are reluctant to learn a new language. In contrast, if you start with Julia as your glorified calculator, when it comes time to do more serious programming you have a much wider array of options available.

It's not about differences from Matlab per se.

---
People naively view global scope as a funny kind enclosing local scope. This is why global scopes worked the way they did in Julia 0.6 and prior:
- If an outer local scope creates a local variable and an inner local scope assigns to it, then that assignment updates the outer local variable.
- If an outer global scope creates a global variable and an inner local scope assigns to it, then that assignment previously updated the outer global variable.
The main difference, however, is:
- Whether an outer local variable exists, by design, does not depend on the order of appearance or execution of the expressions in the outer local scope.
- Whether a global variable exists, however, cannot be independent of order, since one evaluates expressions in global scope, one at a time.
Moreover, since global scopes are often quite lengthy—not infrequently spread across multiple files—having the meaning of an expression depend upon other expressions an arbitrary distance from it, is a “spooky action at a distance” effect, and as such, quite undesirable.
---
This last observation shows why having the two different versions of a for loop at global scope behave differently is problematic:
```jl
# file1.jl
for i = 1:5
a += 1
end
```
```jl
# file2.jl
a = 1
```
```jl
# file3.jl

a += 1
end

```jl
# main.jl
include(""file1.jl"")
include(""file2.jl"")

I think this is a false equivalence — there is a **vast disparity in the level of potential confusion** here.

Absolutely not. Do you seriously want to go back to the pre-v0.2 world (see #1571 and #330) of loop scope?
We have actually never fully supported copying and pasting code from a function line-by-line into the REPL. So we can view this as an opportunity to make that work. Specifically, while it ""worked"" for `for` loops, it did not work for inner functions:
```
x = 0
f(y) = (x=y)
```
Inside a function, `f` will mutate the `x` from the first line. In the REPL it won't. But with a transformation like that in SoftGlobalScope.jl it could work. Of course, we probably wouldn't want that on by default since then pasting stand-alone function definitions wouldn't work. The first thing that comes to mind is a REPL mode for line-by-line function debugging."

I very much appreciate this sentiment and for my use cases it would really help. From my perspective it is really about making the REPL as useful as possible rather than changing the scoping rules of the language directly. That said, the more I think about this problem the more I see the conflicting views I (personally) hold as to what the REPL should do.
To be concrete, I'd very much like it if the REPL matched the scoping rules of a function body; i.e., variables are local rather than global and you can just copy-and-paste code directly from a function and know that it will work. I imagine a naive implementation would be something like let-block wrapping (as has been mention previously) of the form
```
julia> b = a + 1
```
being transformed into
```julia
let a = _vars[:a]::Float64 # extract the variables used from the backing store
# Code from the REPL
b = a + 1
# Save assigned variables back to the backing store
_vars[:b] = b
end
```
Done properly (i.e., by someone who knows what they are doing), I imagine that this would have a number of benefits over the existing REPL. 1. previous workflows with interactive data analysis/computation just work. 2. far fewer posts on Discourse where the basic response is ""stop benchmarking with global variables"" - everything would be local and so hopefully fast! :) 3. copy-and-paste to/from a function body works as expected. 4. a `workspace()` like function is trivial if the backing store is some sort of Dict; just clear it out. 5. globals become explicit - things are local unless you specifically ask for them to be global; this is a big advantage from my perspective, I don't like implicitly creating globals. A very minor final point (and I hestiate to add this!), this would match the behaviour of Matlab making it easier for people transitioning - at the Matlab REPL all variables seem to be local unless explicitly annotated as global. Until a few hours ago this story sounded great to me. But after Jeff's comment about functions I thought about pasting in stand-alone function definitions and how this approach would basically prevent that since function definitions should go in the global scope (at least, that is probably what is intended); but then what if they *were* intended to go into the local scope (an inner function)? There is no information to disambiguate the two possibilities. It would seem that two REPL modes are needed, one with local scope and one global scope. On one hand that could be very confusing (imagine the Discourse posts...) but on the other it could be extremely useful. (Having both REPL modes would also be non-breaking since you are just introducing new functionality :) )
Going for the halfway house of `SoftGlobalScope.jl` might end up being the least confusing compromise but my worry is that it's just another set of rules to remember (which things work in the REPL but not in my function body/global scope and vice-versa).

Nevertheless, this does not mean that this behavior is not a source of bugs or unexpected results; just that after the user has figured it out, it was recognized as correct behavior and thus did not prompt an issue/complaint.
> In Julia 1.0, I'm honestly worried about what I will do if I'm in the middle of a linear-algebra lecture and have to mysteriously type a global keyword
I sympathize with this problem. When I taught into some simple programming to econ students necessary for a course, I usually suggested that they go back and forth between wrapping code in functions, and simply commenting out `function` and `end` and running things in the global scope, so they could inspect what is happening. This pretty much made up for the lack of debugging infrastructure at that time in Julia.
It appears this approach is no longer feasible. But I wonder if it was really the right way to do it anyway, and in the meantime various things have improved a lot (#265 was fixed, [Revise.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl) and recently [Rebugger.j](https://github.com/timholy/Rebugger.jl) have improved workflow/debugging considerably).
It seems that this issue does not bother experienced users very much, the main concern is confusion in a pedagogical setting.

IIRC, the complaint was never that assigning to a global variable in a global loop had the surprising side effect of modifying a global.

Arguably that's the point where you should introduce functions, so I don't think it's so bad. Copy-pasting code between the REPL and function bodies will work (mostly), which is probably good enough.
Then we also have the option of further justifying/clarifying the distinction by making REPL variables somehow local to the REPL --- i.e. not normal global variables, not available as `Main.x`.

good debugger and) even for experienced programmers (and is often one of
the reasons to prefer a dynamic language). Of course for the experienced
programmers, being optional shouldn't be a problem; For novice users it
would be preferably the default.
@StefanKarpinski As a naive programmer, I don't really see what is so wrong in viewing the
global scope as a funny kind enclosing local scope, especially in dynamic
languages. I do understand that from a compiler point of view it is not
necessarily correct (in Julia), but it is a nice, easy and useful model
for a (naive) programmer. (I also suspect it might be actually implemented that way in
some languages).
Julia also seems to presents it that way to the programmer:
The following function function will give the error ""a not defined"", which
it will not do if a=1 is put before the for loop.
function test()
for i = 1:10
a=a+i
end
a=1
@show a
end
which, unless I complete misunderstood, seems at odds with ""Whether an
outer local variable exists, by design, does not depend on the order of
appearance or execution of the expressions in the outer local scope"".
I very much agree with avoiding ""spooky action at a distance"", and much
prefer explicit definition for using globals at the function/call stack
level and would personally also like having something like loading from a file in
its own scope, and requiring explicit definition for using global variables.
At the level of loops is going a bit to far for me though, as the
definitions/context is usually quite near.
The 3 files example is a bit contrived (and fails with the expected ""a not
defined"" error): You would normally put the initial definition in the same
file. There is actual spooky danger in this (and I have been bitten by it
in other languages) in that includes are run in the global scope, so you
are inadvertently defining a global variable that may interfere with other
code. However, having to use global in the loop is not a solution to
this problem.
wrt to the long-running REPL session:
The current behaviour replaces a very rare and easy to spot failure mode
for running an online example in the REPL (you miss copy/pasting the
initial definition of the variable before the loop, and already have the
same variable defined globally from something previous) with not being
able to run an online example correctly if it is part of a function
(without adding global everywhere), and not solving the problem if it is
not (if global is already there in the online code, you will still use the
wrong value in the already existing global variable)"

Indeed Rebugger (which is exactly that) works properly on 1.0 only because it lacks the scope deprecation of 0.7, and could never be made to work on 0.6. However, I'm pleased to be able to verify that SoftGlobalScope.jl seems not to break that. For example, if you step deeply enough into `show([1,2,4])` you get here:
```julia
show_delim_array(io::IO, itr::Union{SimpleVector, AbstractArray}, op, delim, cl, delim_one) in Base at show.jl:649
io = IOContext(Base.TTY(RawFD(0x0000000d) open, 0 bytes waiting))
itr = [1, 2, 4]
op = [
delim = ,
cl = ]
delim_one = false
i1 = 1
l = 3
rebug> eval(softscope(Main, :(@eval Base let (io, itr, op, delim, cl, delim_one, i1, l) = Main.Rebugger.getstored(""bbf69398-aac5-11e8-1427-0158b103a88c"")
begin
print(io, op)
if !(show_circular(io, itr))
recur_io = IOContext(io, :SHOWN_SET => itr)
if !(haskey(io, :compact))
recur_io = IOContext(recur_io, :compact => true)
end
first = true
i = i1
if l >= i1
while true
if !(isassigned(itr, i))
print(io, undef_ref_str)
else
x = itr[i]
show(recur_io, x)
end
i += 1
if i > l
delim_one && (first && print(io, delim))
break
end
first = false
print(io, delim)
print(io, ' ')
end
end
end
print(io, cl)
end
end)))
[1, 2, 4]
```
So it works fine on 1.0 (with or without `softscope`). On 0.7, evaluating this (with or without `softscope`) will yield
```julia
┌ Warning: Deprecated syntax `implicit assignment to global variable `first``.
│ Use `global first` instead.

Does this mean that the module `Main` has sometimes a soft scope (say at the REPL prompt) and sometimes a hard scope (say when `julia -L script.jl`)? Would it not make sense to say that `Main` always has soft scope? And a module can opt-in to soft scope by `using SoftGlobalScope`?"

A way to solve/alleviate this problem without major incompatibilty would be to add an option to the julia cmdline to use softscope (or alternative) , e.g. julia -f programfile, and show this option in any description/tutorial that a beginner is likely to come across.
I also see a potential alternative for the softscope that may have some advantages (though i am probably overlooking disadvantages): What if a file (a called script) would always introduce its own local scope: scoping rules would be in complete consistency with those in functions, and with the expectations of a lot of users.

That. The other one to seriously consider is Juno.

It would be very confusing to the user if the same text changes when in a `@testset` vs. not when using Atom's integration, and is inconsistent with doing `] test` as well.

That is not how this works. You can't get any change to the language you want just by calling the current behavior a bug.
I reeeally don't think there should be a command line option for this. Then every piece of julia code will have to come with a comment or something telling you which option to use. Some kind of parser directive in a source file would be a bit better, but even better still would be to have a fixed rule. For example, hard scope inside modules only might make sense.
Let me try again to provide an explanation of this that might be useful for avoiding the mania, hysteria, and carnage people are seeing in the classroom:
""
Julia has two kinds of variables: local and global. Variables you introduce in the REPL or at the top level, outside of anything else, are global. Variables introduced inside functions and loops are local. Updating global variables in a program is generally bad, so if you're inside a loop or function and want to update a global, you have to be explicit about it by writing the `global` declaration again.
""
Perhaps that can be improved; suggestions welcome. I know, you'd rather not need any sort of explanation at all. I get that. But it doesn't seem so bad to me."

I agree. Sounds like a teaching and communication headache to me.
> For example, hard scope inside modules only might make sense.
Just so I understand: if I had a short script (not in a module!) in a `.jl` file which I had copied from an IJulia notebook, then if I ran that code in either the REPL directly or shift-enter in Juno, then it would behave consistently as soft-scope... but if I copied it instead of a `module` block then it would yell at me about globals? But if I copied that code inside of functions inside of a module, then it should work.
If so, that makes complete sense,is very teachable and coherent. Top-level scripts are an interactive interface for exploration, etc. but you would never put that kind of code in a module. Modules are something that you should fill with functions are very carefully considered globals. It would be easy to tell people about those rules."
1686,352373552,423361708,None,"> Do you want to write var x = 0 to introduce every variable? That would also ""fix"" this, and be more like other languages.
No, I'd rather not! But scripting languages that have a REPL rarely do that (e.g. ruby, python, R, ...), they behave like Julia v0.6 did.
> Julia has two kinds of variables: local and global. Variables you introduce in the REPL or at the top level, outside of anything else, are global.

I completely understand what you're saying here, and I won't (touch wood!) make this mistake again. But the whole problem I'm worried about is not me. I've found it relatively easy to introduce scope (without mentioning it directly) when I explain that variables inside functions can't see ones outside and vice-versa (even though that's more an aspiration than a fact in R!), because functions themselves are already a _relatively_ advanced concept. But this hits much earlier in the learning curve here where we don't want anything remotely as complicated as scope to be impinging on people...
Note also it's not just ""_variables you introduce in the REPL or at the top level, outside of anything else, are global_"" and ""_variables introduced inside functions and loops are local_"", it's also that variables in if statements in the REPL or at the top level are global but variables in a `@testset` are local. We end up down a rabbit-hole of ""just try it and work out for yourself whether it's local or global, good luck"".
However, I agree with @jlperla - the proposal that ""hard scope inside modules only might make sense"" seems completely fine to me! Modules are a sufficiently advanced concept again... if soft scope works for the REPL and scripts, that's absolutely fine."

What I'm trying to get at is that I feel a simple description of global vs. local is sufficient for early-stage teaching --- you don't even need to say the word ""scope"" (it does not occur at all in my explanation above). When you're just showing some simple expressions and loops in the REPL, you're not teaching people about testsets and you don't need an exhaustive list of the scoping behavior of everything in the language.
My only point is, this change does not suddenly make it necessary to teach lots of details about the language up front. You can still ignore the vast majority of stuff about scopes, testsets, etc., and a simple line on global vs. local should suffice."
1688,352373552,423367678,None,"> and a simple line on global vs. local should suffice.
In a world where everyone started writing all of their code from scratch, I would agree completely.
The issue is that you need to teach students not just about scope, but also about understanding the scope of where they copy-pasted code they got from. You need to teach them that if they copy-paste code that is on stackexchange within a function or a let block that they need to scan through it and find where to add ""global"" if they are pasting it into the REPL or a `.jl` file. But if they are copying that code inside a function or into the Jupyter notebook. they shouldn't. And if they find code inside of a stackexchange or tutorial page that has global variables in it, but they want to copy and modify that code inside of their own function, then they need to strip out the global.
And then students start asking why does `for` create this scope they need to worry about but not other things...."

Pop quiz: in julia 0.6, is `x` global or local:
```
for i = 1:10
x = i
end
```
The answer is that there's no way to know, because it depends on whether a global `x` has been defined before. Now, you can say for sure that it is local."

Who do you think designed and implemented it in the first place? We have already committed to changing the interactive behavior.

It sounds interactive when you call it ""a script"" but it sounds far less interactive when you call it ""a program""—yet they are exactly the same thing.

Therefore, if there is any sacrifice in performance at the main program for using the same notation and constructions than in the functions, I find that totally acceptable, much more acceptable than trying to understand and teach these scoping rules and not being able to copy and paste codes from one place to another.
By the way, I am a newbie in Julia yet, having chosen it to teach some high-school and undergraduate students some basics of simulations of physical systems. And I am already hopping this issue returns to the 'normal' behavior of previous versions, because it gives us quite a headache."

It sounds like you are planning to put that directly into the lowering code (`julia-syntax.scm`), rather than as a syntax rewriting ala SoftScope.jl?

Thank *you*, for nothing. I'd file a bug report about people with pedophile'ish usernames with such high exposure in a project that Canonical seems to care so much about, but your form is (predictably) excessive. No thanks.
For those who might find this on Google, don't bother with that patch/commit. If your pool got userobj_accounting enabled it is now a Linux-only pool. You'll have to destroy it, since per the (broken) explanation in the manpage, once active it cannot be decactivated. Sort of like that Doomsday Machine that Slim Pickens was after...."

Hi Fernando - thanks for the response.
Here is the pertinent info in my sources.list:
deb http://mirrors.linode.com/ubuntu/ bionic universe
deb http://mirrors.linode.com/ubuntu/ bionic-updates universe
So I assumed these would be the same as the ones you suggested in your comment, since ""bionic universe"" and ""bionic-updates universe"". However, it's a mirror on Linode, so maybe it's different.
I'll try with the archive repos you suggested and see what happens.
Thanks"

Heyo,
After a couple installation cycle and purges of nginx, I'm still getting a similar response:

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have

Could be a mismatch between kernel and userland ABI:
In case you upgraded from a way older version (=didn't `emerge zfs` for quite some time) you still might have the old userland binaries somewhere in your path, their location changed a while ago.
Similar problem (when you can only locate the new version in your path) could happen when the old kernel module is still loaded but the new version of the userland is used.
The compilation error could be caused in concert with grsecurity, see https://forums.grsecurity.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3890 for a similar case (and possibly a solution)."

1797,364146679,425857028,None,"Thanks for replies. About zfs binary stopped working I know, it is because I compiled a new version of zfs and still use old version of zfs-kmod.
I am using this kernel for a long time and compilation of zfs worked well always. My last successful compilation was about 4-6 commits ago to the master. I read this link about grsecurity, but didn't found a solution. Also, I don't see any grsecurity errors at dmesg while compiling. So now I have new zfs and old zfs-kmod and I am afraid to reboot, I don't know how to compile the same version in gentoo or back-forward for some commits.
I think the problem is related to some new code in last commits, the kernel version or gcc version. I am using zfs (master) 1.5+ years at 4.9.24-grsec and about a year on 4.9.74-grsec (minipli), and compilation always was successful. Please help me resolve these issues.

Since this begs finally some proper attention, I will describe this issue (feel free to remove the comment later as you obviously are seemingly easily to have your feelings hurt regardless of whether the other person intended so or not...).
I'll just clarify a few things: I've never asked for help in the channel and treated someone ""poorly"". I responded ironically to ptx0's messages, after he spent the past few hours being dismissive or condescending to other people, obviously in some cases users with a very limited skill around ZFS, but that does not merit acting like an imbecile. None of them were insults or hostile, they simply pointed out that ptx0 was assuming things constantly and then replying with an air of arrogance and usually in a condescending tone, despite himself being far from a beacon of excellence as far as technical skill or coding go. Immediately after he proceeded to ban me from the channel, to which I responded in -social pointing out that his attitude and actions making him look puerile and petty regardless of the nature of the ""offense"" by someone else. This knee-jerk reaction came motivated more by petty personal sentiments (and sharing those with some others who, well, fit that profile) than any actually reasonable reasons.
Now, on the project: you are routinely accepting patches quite obviously without really doing your due diligence, ensuring proper QA, etc. Case in point, the one we have here. It's painful to see that you waste more time on petty nothings over actually making your code or merged patches look like something with a modicum of technical quality. The control over whether contributors are just copy-pasting from other spots (*hint* licensing violations get people sued), if the patches actually conflict with major kernel features, or symbol exports, or..... is lacking all over the place.
How about instead of making up half-truths about people offending your feelings, or your buddies' feelings, you go and properly benefit from the resources you so adamantly defend (and ask others to work with): How difficult was it to grab the patch I sent you from the link, test it, test it again, sign it off and merge it? You need to go around deleting comments and engaging in conversation with the other troll, but you are too busy to actually merge an out of band patch while you waste time over petty fights? Well, good luck with that. And you are surprised ZoL is not taken seriously anywhere but by the homelab/non-enterprise crowd. If you want to be a primadonna, at least have the cards in your sleeve to back it up: you can't justify it right now with the standard you are providing your users. And it runs in ring0, so go figure a better way to fend off all those users popping up on IRC asking about destroyed data because you merged a patch from a pull-request that would not stand a moment in the LKML."

I'll sound pushy, but I think it would be fair that [billion dollars companies](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273693/bskybs-annual-revenue/) that have been using an open source software for years would consider helping the company behind the technology."

1824,370963615,430587200,None,"Sorry if I sounded harsh, that wasn't my intent.
We've drawn a clear line between what goes in Gatling OSS and what goes in Gatling FrontLine:
all new things related to stats/exports/integrations go into Gatling FrontLine.
We're more than happy with contributions related to core Gatling features such as HTTP and users orchestration. But we can't make any exception to the above rule."
1825,370963615,430647906,None,"@slandelle I am sorry but I don't really understand your reasoning, although I understand your concern around protecting the Enterprise value.
Just to confirm, your strategy is to prefer for us to fork this project so that we can use a logger for a single line of code where you are currently using println, pushing us further away from wanting the Enterprise solution because you are classifying using a logger to output the summary as part of `stats/exports/integrations`, although that information is already being outputted in a different form? To be honest, this entire thread so far makes me far less inclined to introduce a dependency on the enterprise project. I believe gatling is great as a project, I believe you should get paid to support and continue working on it full time, I also believe large companies should pay and help support opensource initiatives. The problem is that I also believe your approach will alienate many people, or at least me and all the people I talk to about this. It's a very simple code change, that actually makes it more consistent, as the majority of of your code base uses loggers (as any developer would expect). You are not even arguing about not outputting that data because it's `stats/enterprise` data. The data is there and available in the logs already! The only difference is the primitive output mechanism. The fact that many modern log shipping frameworks expect json/structured logs means that using println automatically makes you a less attractive product for both enterprise and non enterprise adopters. These println statements just create noise in most modern log shipping frameworks I have worked with as they cannot be interpreted as a single event. This is genuine feedback.
I would urge you to reconsider the quick decision, because I believe this suggestion exposes no more information than you currently do, moves you towards a more standardized output like the rest of your code base, and would actually show you positively engaging in improving your entire product offering, OSS and Enterprise. The functionality you are planning as part of Enterprise are still attractive to companies like ours, e.g. aggregation of metrics etc, grafana datasources etc. I think you've convinced yourself that any improvements to OSS is a risk to Enterprise. Just doesn't sit well with me."
1826,370963615,430667858,None,"@balooo Thank you for sharing your concerns. We don’t see improvements of the OSS as a risk, quite the contrary: you can have a look at all the work that’s been put into upcoming Gatling 3 OSS.
Our Enterprise version, Gatling FrontLine, aims to provide our users with advanced features in terms of metrics, integration and automation. This Enterprise version was designed by the feedback of our users who built their own integrations with Gatling but then struggled to stabilize them and maintain them over time.
We believe this Enterprise version is a win-win for everyone: we make you save time and money, we guarantee you stability and, at the same time, you help the open-source project continue to develop.
We would be more than happy to continue this discussion live and convince you that we are still committed to improve load testing, both for our OSS users and for our enterprise customers.
Anyway, thank you for using Gatling"
1827,370963615,430685695,None,"@slandelle Thanks for the reply, but I still don't think you actually addressed the points I was trying to raise regarding this particular issue. I still don't understand how the suggested change is against your commercial strategy. The points I was trying to articulate are that this request:
- doesn't expose any data that would previously be inaccessible / enterprise.
- doesn't suggest structuring the results in a way that is easier to parse/interpret programatically
- only suggests what we believe is better practice by outputting using a logger which is the standard practice
- would allow for common, modern log shippers to ship your output with our creating message noise, where each println is interpreted as a new log event.
I literally don't see a single reason you would be against it this request. I've read through your comments multiple times and I still don't see a single argument you have given explaining why . > Sorry, but all new features regarding stats (additional stats, pushing stats elsewhere) fall into the scope of FrontLine, our Enterprise version.
Fair enough to that statement, but we're not talking about additional stats, pushing stats or anything about stats. We're talking about not using a logger for your output which causes problems when using industry standard shipping practices that expect structured logs."

Just to piggyback on some of the comments above, this does seem like a poor choice of a change to include in a patch release.

Is this really about autoloading and coding style? Because Fabien's thread is clear about this: they both are great PSRs, it's mostly the ""new wave of incoming PSRs"" that's not interop and kinda breaks the initial project into a more opinionated set of rules instead of an interop one"

### Background
**Context**
I have been working over the last few days with the strapi code-base add support for geographical data types (GeoJSON, to be more precise). I was pleased to see that strapi already had support for JSON, so I repurposed the code for `InputJSON` and `InputJSONWithErrors` components to create the GeoJSON content-type. To do so, I've followed the instructions posted on [this issue](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/483#issuecomment-358971985) **Why a separate GeoJSON content-type? (A real world use-case)**
Our organization primarily works with local governments in Nepal to build official portals that help them connect with their citizens. In doing so, some offices have realized a need to include a feature that allows them to visualize all of capital-projects for the fiscal year. See image below:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24402285/50380691-535ddf00-0697-11e9-9e77-2cad4e1674d7.png)
We want government officials to be able to upload geographic information on their own. Due to their limited technical knowledge, we found that the best way to get this done is by providing them with a user-interface to draw out the project.
I've gone ahead and created a component to facilitate the same. ### Steps taken:
**Steps to display new input in the content type builder**
- To display my new field I have added it it in the `/plugins/content-type-builder/admin/src/containers/Form/forms.json`file.
- I've also populated the corresponding translations in the `/plugins/content-type-builder/admin/src/translations` folder. However, since I don't know language other than English, I've used english everywhere.
- I added another `switch-case` statement inside `strapi/plugins/strapi-hook-mongoose/lib/utils/index.js` file for my new content-type (geojson), simply copy pasting the one for json. The plugin didn't run until I did that.
- I have also added images for my new content type in the `AttributeRow` and `AttributeCard` components.
- I was thus able to display my new attribute in the plugin (this might have an impact on the plugin's component)
**Using my new type in the content manager**
- I had to add a few new packages npm packages `(mapbox gl-js, @mapbox/mapbox-gl-js-draw, @mapbox/geojson-extent etc.)` and css files, I did not know how to add CSS files so i directly used the index.html file in the `admin/admin/src/index.html` I know this is not optimal, what are my options?
- When adding `@mapbox/mapbox-gl-js-draw` I ran into issues as I rebuilt the `content-manager` plugin. So for my present purpose, I have served the CDN through my public directory `/public`, I’m aware this is not the best way to do things. Looking forward to your inputs here too.
- I also had to update the `containers/saga.js` and update the following line :
`const cleanedData = (attrType === 'json' || attrType==='geojson') ? record[current] : cleanData(record[current], 'value', 'id');`
- In the content manager plugin I modified the `Edit` container and its children in order to display my new field type.
- I created the `InpuGJSON` and `InputGJSONWithErrors` component and served them through the `Edit` component as suggested. ### How it looks
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24402285/50380851-b05c9380-069d-11e9-8525-9452bbb743fa.png)
### Features:
The GeoJSON input component allows a user to:
- Upload a `.geojson` file.
- Preview and modify uploaded `.geojson` in the browser.
- Draw custom points, lines and polygons (multiple points, lines and polygons also allowed) directly through the tool.
- Search for a place using a search box (using `mapbox-generic-geocoder` with OSM Nominatim), and zoom in to the location.
### Questions/Comments:
- What is the right way to use CDNs for JS and CSS in strapi? Im not sure if i followed standard practices for the same.
- Currently I've used [Maptiler Cloud](https://cloud.maptiler.com/) for hosting my vector tiles. This service allows upto 100000 free views in a month. If needed I can set up a map tile server for the same.
- All of my changes can be found at [my fork of strapi here](https://github.com/arkoblog/strapi).
- I'm looking forward to someone from strapi going through my code and pointing out blunders, mistakes so that I can work on the same. I've also submitted a pull request to facilitate the same."

> What is the right way to use CDNs for JS and CSS in strapi? Im not sure if i followed standard practices for the same.
Maybe you can try something like this in the `content-manager/admin/src/components/InputGJSONWithErrors`:
```
import '<my-package/dist/<stylesheet>.css';
// ... rest of the code
```
If it doesn't work, well you can try to create the tag manually and insert it into the dom or just hardcode it in the index.html like you did. I prefer the first option which is to import the stylesheet.

The vector tiles that I'm currently using comes from MapTiler Cloud ([see pricing here](https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/plans/)). I'm currently using the free plan which allows upto 100,000 requests a month. I guess what I'm asking is if that would be enough. If not, we will have to look for other free options (which I'm sure are available, I just haven't spent enough time researching on the same).

Oh that can be easily done through this new content-type. In fact, it is multi-geometry by default, meaning you can add one (or many points), lines and polygons, as part of a single entry. It gets captured as a FeatureCollection ([https://macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html#featurecollection](https://macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html#featurecollection))"

- Re-work the underlying discard mechanism to use a new ZIO type rather than the DKIOCFREE ioctl.

What refreshing has always done in this and other buffers is to update to reflect the situation in the local repository. *That* is what most users would expect and to instead perform a destructive operation would be very surprising and dangerous.
So I won't add the requested feature, but you can easily implement it using `magit-post-refresh-hook`."
1914,398264957,453543222,Insulting,"You probably don't understand what `git remote prune origin` does...
It doesn't do anything destructive in the remote repository. It
synchronizes your *local* refs with the remote refs, taking *remote*
as the source of truth, and updating the local to reflect it. Thus,
it doesn't do any destructive changes at all, neither locally nor
remotely. The functionality of Git is just wrong when it does a
fetch, it should've also fetched the refs, but... it doesn't. And I'm
just too tired of Git's boolshit to try to fight it.
Think about this operation as cache invalidation, all it does is it
instructs to invalidate the local cache of remote refs, which it
should've been doing by default anyways.

## Explanation
`period` and `duration` act differently when adding a timespan to a date. Consider a simpler example: on the 30th of January what's the date on the calendar in a month from now? `period` will tell you it's 30th of February and as this is not possible will produce an NA
```r
ymd_hms(""2021-01-30 11:00:00"") + months(1) # NA

`duration` will add some vague 30 days and return a different date depending on the year. ```r

1946,421471669,528998731,None,"Okay, so I think that there is a bug that has been there since essentially the beginning of the package.
The summary is that I think that right here, there should be another if branch that says if we are ONLY updating using hours/min/sec or lower, then it should use `cl_new.pre` if the new civil seconds amount is above the old civil seconds amount (i.e. we went forward), otherwise use `cl_new.post` (we went backwards).

I've read the docs in `?Period-class`, and I know you want this reversible property:
```
date + period - period = date
```
I would argue that if it the arithmetic only involves hours/minutes/seconds then this is reversible. For my example above, I think that this is perfectly reasonable behavior (lubridate doesn't do this right now):
``` r

1947,421471669,529114335,None,"Hmm okay I think the rule could be if we land in the spring forward daylight savings time gap and `(period size) <= (dst gap size)` then it is a reversible operation and we should get a real date and not an `NA`. 99% of the time this means if `(period size) <= 1 hour`, but there are the _rare_ cases where a dst gap is not 1 hour.
(Note that this would imply that the original issue would still be an `NA` because `minutes(1160)` is larger than 1 hour, and would not be reversible)
I would try to implement this, but I can't figure out how to get the size of the dst gap using cctz. The newest version of google's cctz has a method for `<time_zone>.next_transition()` and `.previous_transition()` which might could be used to get the borders of the gap. Then the difference would be the size. https://github.com/google/cctz/blob/b4935eef53820cf1643355bb15e013b4167a2867/include/cctz/time_zone.h#L188

That rule is unfortunate. There is no solid reason to follow it and it caused a lot of trouble with the package. There is a new lower level package `timechange` which has a clear defined semantics and allows a full control over how things are rolled both on month change and DST.

1954,421471669,813387353,None,"For anyone doing arithmetic with _hours, minutes, or seconds_ with lubridate, you likely want to use Durations objects (like `dhours()`) rather than Period objects (like `hours()`). For arithmetic with more granular units of time like days, months or years, you probably want to stick with Period objects.
So, if using lubridate, my advice for @Demetrio92 and @robertwwalker is to switch to `dminutes()` and `dhours()` as that seems to be what you are expecting. That will match your intuition if you were expecting a result equal to ""sitting in a chair for 1160 minutes, then looking at the clock"" (assuming that your clock automatically adjusts itself for DST).
You could also try using [clock](https://clock.r-lib.org/). The POSIXct API in clock defaults to the behavior I described in the first paragraph, so it might feel more intuitive.

Reading `period` docs
> Within a Period object, time units do not have a fixed length (except for seconds) until they are added to a date-time. ... When math is performed with a period object, each unit is applied separately. How the length of a period is distributed among its units is non-trivial. For example, when leap seconds occur 1 minute is longer than 60 seconds.
> Periods track the change in the ""clock time"" between two date-times. They are measured in common time related units: years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Each unit except for seconds must be expressed in integer values.
I do not see why this description contradicts my expected output. Specifically it says stuff like >or example, when leap seconds occur 1 minute is longer than 60 seconds. My impression here would be that periods are more robust than durations. -----
I generally agree, the issue is more deep than just two functions that supposed to do the same. Still, worst case, rename `minutes` into `pminutes`. ----
I am glad `period` now contains a warning. At least people who carefully study the docs will be aware. > Note: Arithmetic with periods can result in undefined behavior when non-existent dates are involved (such as February 29th in non-leap years). Please see Period for more details and %m+% and add_with_rollback() for alternative operations.
Coming from postgres I just did `+minutes()` and it worked as expected without any issues until it didn't. I wasn't even aware there were two ways of doing this in `lubridate`"

Imagine the (completely implausible I hope) scenario where the time-lords decide that they're going to do a leap second at the same time as a daylight savings change.
Here's how I'd expect `hours` and `dhours` to act:
""2021-04-04 02:15:00 NZDT"" + hours(1) == ""2021-04-04 02:15:00 NZST""
""2021-04-04 02:15:00 NZDT"" + dhours(1) == ""2021-04-04 02:14:59 NZST""

Hmm, @pitakakariki from this example it looks to me like you might misunderstand how Period and Duration are supposed to be working. Let me try explaining. I'll use types from clock, since they allow me to explicitly show the intermediate steps that are happening under the hood.
``` r
library(clock)
x <- date_time_parse(""2021-04-04 02:15:00"", ""Pacific/Auckland"", ambiguous = ""earliest"")
x
#> [1] ""2021-04-04 02:15:00 NZDT""
# Adding a lubridate ""Period"" is like:
# - Dropping the original time zone completely
# - Adding the unit of time
# - Adding the original time zone back (if possible)
# Adding a lubridate ""Duration"" is like:
# - Converting the original time zone to UTC (where DST never affects you)
# - Adding the unit of time
# - Adding the original time zone back (which is always possible)
# We can show these explicitly with clock's naive-time and sys-time types, which
# mimic dropping the original time zone and converting to UTC respectively.
```
``` r
## Period example:
# Notice this has no implied zone attached
nt <- as_naive_time(x)
nt
#> <time_point<naive><second>[1]>
#> [1] ""2021-04-04 02:15:00""
# Now we add the time. Since there is no implied time zone, this doesn't
# have to do with the DST fallback whatsoever.
nt_plus_hour <- nt + duration_hours(1)
nt_plus_hour
#> <time_point<naive><second>[1]>
#> [1] ""2021-04-04 03:15:00""
# Now we convert back to Pacific/Auckland. Since the 3 o'clock hour is past
# the DST fallback, there is no ambiguity in the conversion, but it may or
# may not be what you want.
as.POSIXct(nt_plus_hour, ""Pacific/Auckland"")
#> [1] ""2021-04-04 03:15:00 NZST""
x + lubridate::hours(1)
#> [1] ""2021-04-04 03:15:00 NZST""
```
``` r
## Duration example:
# This is in UTC time, notice how the hour has shifted
st <- as_sys_time(x)
st
#> <time_point<sys><second>[1]>
#> [1] ""2021-04-03 13:15:00""
# Now we add the time in UTC. DST can never affect this.
st_plus_hour <- st + duration_hours(1)
st_plus_hour
#> <time_point<sys><second>[1]>
#> [1] ""2021-04-03 14:15:00""
# Now convert back to Pacific/Auckland. This just shifts by the appropriate
# UTC offset to get the Pacific/Auckland time.
as.POSIXct(st_plus_hour, ""Pacific/Auckland"")
#> [1] ""2021-04-04 02:15:00 NZST""
x + lubridate::dhours(1)

If adding `hours(1)` to 2:15am DT and 2:15am ST both give us 3:15am ST, then there's no way to subtract `hours(1)` from 3:15am ST that's consistent with reversibility."

Reversibility can never by achieved no matter what we do.

But I am going to drop it like a hot potato if the creators of Ruby and Rails don't come up with some way to establish specific CoC's. Right now, moderators are going around calling people names like trolls, cursing left and right and causing arguments. Then they accuse everyone else of what they started. There needs to be some kind of controls and certifications that is granted as an authorized representative of Rails before anyone can open a group under the copyright. A lot of the Rails groups have chat rooms for politics and unrelated matters. Yet, half the CoC forbids talking about those things. I've seen entire Rails groups where a few friends of the moderators use it as their political pulpit. Then they lure people into discussions and ban them when they don't agree.
This is just 1 example of how a moderator talks to people.

1970,430055555,430055555,None,"## Description
With vertically oriented games, Retroarch switches the emulator-provided width and height. For example, if the width/height is supposed to be 320x240, RA will switch this to 240x320. This only occurs with vertically oriented games. I tested this in both MAME and FBA using the Windows 64 bit version of RA. ### Expected behavior
The game to be displayed using the correct resolution (width/height). ### Actual behavior
The height and width is switched when a vertically oriented game is loaded. ### Steps to reproduce the bug
1. load any vertically oriented game in either FBA or MAME using Windows 64 bit version of RA (example: DonPachi)
2. under video settings, enable integer scale. 3. set ""custom aspect ratio width/height"" to 1x.
4. look at ""custom aspect ratio width/height"" to see that it says 240 for width and 320 for height. This is the reverse of what it should be; it should be 240 for height and 320 for width. ### Bisect Results
I first noticed this a few days ago. ### Version/Commit

1971,430055555,480553748,None,some arcades have the monitor rotated 90 degrees. The can the emulator can either rotate the image to the displays orientation or display it as intended and you rotated your display 90 degrees
1972,430055555,480587874,None,"I understand that, but the emulator-provided resolution should not be changed from the correct resolution, regardless of orientation. If the game is 320x240 it should be output as 320x240, not 240x320. The user can flip it or rotate it or resize it or whatever, but the output resolution from the emulator should remain the same (eg, 320x240 should be output as 320x240 before the user does stuff to it). Otherwise you get scaling artifacts unless you just happen to adjust the y axis to a multiple of both 240 and 320 (eg, 960). And if you’re playing a game that uses a weird resolution like 19XX (384x240), then it causes big problems with overscan or underscan when using integer scaling. As of right now, video aspect ratio for vertical games must be configured manually (custom ratio width/height, non-integer) along with custom ratio x/y position, because the resolution/ratio for vertical games isn’t being detected correctly."
1973,430055555,480592063,None,"the thing is the topic say the width and height are switched they simply arent it just a rotated monitor. It draws the image on the monitor as 4:3 then you flip the monitor physically this changes it to 3:4 on real hardware as far as the hardware is concerned its a normal 4:3 device but your rendering the image 90 degrees rotated.
In mame2003 or plus just use tate mode this stop the rotation and you need to flip your monitor like a real one. look at sf2 this is on a 4:3 screen look at the resolution of the game it use crt timing when rendering to look the way it does in a crt if you used the literal resolution for sf2 the gfx would be overly stretched."

I understand very well that certain games are meant to be displayed vertically. This doesn’t change anything that I’ve said. With a vertically-oriented 320x240 game, width should say 320 and height should say 240, and the displayed image should be sideways. On a 4:3 CRT monitor the image would be 320x240 and sideways. You then rotate the monitor 90 degrees. This doesn’t change the image to 240x320. It is still 320x240 but now it is rotated 90 degrees so it is no longer sideways.
Altering the internal resolution of the game is incorrect, and will always result in scaling artifacts unless you happen to use a resolution that is a multiple of both 320 and 240."

Switching height/width (Tate mode off) should be something that the user has to select because it's altering the original output of the emulated hardware. Anything done to alter the original output of the emulated hardware in this way should be something that the user has to manually select.

1994,430055555,480614871,None,"I'm not just being pedantic, here. The width/height being switched isn't helpful and causes numerous potential issues. With the current behavior of height/width being automatically switched with vertical games, you still have to rotate the image if you want correct aspect ratio and orientation or to avoid a huge amount of letterboxing, and with height/width being switched like this, it results in scaling artifacts unless you happen to choose a resolution that is a multiple of both 320 and 240. Furthermore, there is still no way that I know of to get any emulator besides MAME 2003 to work correctly. The current rationale of ""people don't want to rotate their displays"" just isn't sufficient to justify this."

So, yes, there is a lot going on here. Each of the cores seems to be handling this in a different way and there are far too many knobs and dials related to this. Disabling vertical mode makes it work in FBA, while enabling tate mode in MAME 2003 makes it work there... how does that make any sense?!

2001,430055555,480628910,None,there is a reason for it to be there clearly this isint a front end issue. It cant guess if you have rotated you monitor 90 degrees physically you need to deal with this as a core option if that is the case.

The user can then rotate the image using the advanced user option under settings -> video -> rotation
<strike>You could also add an option under video settings (""automatically rotate vertical games 90 degrees"" or something) to automatically set settings -> video -> rotation -> 90 degrees whenever a vertical oriented game is detected.

The resolution/aspect ratio output by the emulator should remain unchanged by the core- see above. A vertical game that is 320x240 should be output as 320x240. The frontend options for video rotation and aspect ratio are more than sufficient and solve the problems related to the way things are currently handled, which are, to wit:
1. it's incorrect according to what the original hardware does
2. it's counter-intuitive
3. it results in scaling artifacts with integer scaling
If people want to play vertical games rotated 90 degrees on their monitors, then they should use the frontend for that. The emulator/core shouldn't alter the actual output."

Altering the height/width of the resolution so that the image is correctly oriented on a non-rotated monitor is altering the output resolution, and thus incorrect. Furthermore, in some cases you still have to rotate the image using the frontend options to get a properly oriented image even though the height/width are being switched; automatically switching the height/width doesn't solve the problem that it is intended to solve and is introducing more problems. You can see this in the above example with MAME 2003; TATE mode on or off still results in a sideways image so that the user either has to rotate it using a front end option or physically rotate their display. The core should just output the unaltered resolution. Altering the resolution, aspect ratio or video rotation is all stuff that should happen on the frontend or through a user option that has to be selected. At the very least, it would be preferable to stop enabling automatic rotation by default and have this be something that the user has to enable through a core option. The default should be the original unaltered image (see the example of standalone FBA, above). The user shouldn't have to dig through multiple menus of confusingly-named settings and apply a lot of trial and error in order to get the emulator to display the original unaltered image."

There is not need to guess anything, this is software development, there is an API, an implementation, and a frontend.
There is an API for this:
https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/blob/master/libretro-common/include/libretro.h#L486
So the players are:
- core
- api
- frontend
Who knows the content needs rotation? The core does.
The environment callback is a set, which means it's telling the frontend to ""do something""
So what should happen could go two ways
a. The core tells the frontend: ""hey video is rotated, adjust aspect ratio from what I reported accordingly""
b. The core tells the frontend: ""hey this content requires rotation, do whatever you need to do so it works properly""
That's all. This is a frontend problem, but before anything can be do about it what we need is clarification from the API side so we can adjust both the frontend and the cores to do whatever needs to be done.

1. automatically switching the width/height for vertical oriented games is altering the output resolution, which is incorrect. The emulator should just output the resolution completely unaltered. Altering what is output by the emulator should always be done by the frontend, or through an option that the user has to manually select, but maybe that's just my opinion. The default should just be whatever the emulator spits out before you start doing stuff to it. 2. rotating the game is something that can be easily handled in the frontend without all of the confusion that currently exists 3. 2 is something that can even be done automatically if desired by the user, through the frontend as explained by fr500.
4. the current method of automatically switching the height/width with vertical games will always result in scaling artifacts no matter what you set the aspect ratio to (unless it's a multiple of both 240 and 320). How can this be considered correct? 5. the current method of automatically switching the height/width of vertical games isn't even making things easier for the user in all cases, because video_allow_rotate = true/false isn't doing the same thing in all cores. The current method is just adding more confusion. My brain is tired. Hopefully the thread I linked to above sheds some additional light on the problem."

There should be a way to make RA work the same with all cores using one of the methods @fr500 described (it may need either a or b depending on what the core is doing).

With vertically oriented games, Retroarch switches the emulator-provided width and height. For example, if the width/height is supposed to be 320x240, RA will switch this to 240x320. This only occurs with vertically oriented games. I tested this in both MAME and FBA using the Windows 64 bit version of RA.

From the thread I just linked to, above:
> BarbuDreadMonSenior Member
> 30m
> > @Nesguy My mistake about width/height being switched for vertical games in fbalpha. While there is no official statement about this, i also think the core should always report resolution before rotation, i changed this behavior in a commit today. Now that it’s settled i would recommend allowing core rotation again and enabling vertical mode, it’s now upscaling properly for me, and there doesn’t seem to be issues with shaders either. One last thing about fbalpha : if you want proper aspect ratio, use core-provided aspect ratio + DAR in core options for fbalpha (actually i’m thinking about removing this core option and always forcing DAR), aspect ratio is per-game and hardcoded in the emulator for each one.
So, yeah. It's not that you're wrong, it's just that you never quite understood what the problem was in the first place. Thankfully, the issue with FBA was recognized and corrected by BarbuDreadMon."
2040,430055555,480966333,None,sending the wrong geometry form the core to fix it i would say thats out of spec and a patch. im sure mark will patch mame2003 and + up to send wrong info so it works in mame2003 and plus. Its trivial to do never the less i wont be changing is as its out of spec to whats really happening. no matter what your little numbers say the resolution is 240 x 320 when rotated :). I wold suggest you use fba for now because every other core will have it the same way most likely. Ps current mame rotates fine its in the tab menu video options of course its wrong as well cause you said so
2041,430055555,481212456,None,"i can explain the reasoning behind TATE mode core option in mame2003:
the emulator sends two bits of information to the retroarch API; the games width and height, and how much it should be rotated:
so, for a typical arcade game, that would be:
**width:** 320
**height:** 240
**rotation:** 0 (none)
now, for a typical arcade vertical game (which were rendered sideways, and then the CRT was rotated when put in the cabinet), that information would be be:
**width:** 240
**height:** 320
**rotation:** 1/3 (90/270 degrees)
the issue is, retroarch uses the sent height and width regardless of whether it has been rotated or not. so, the emulator has to send the width and height of the game on the presumption that the rotation has happened. so, if you set `video_allow_rotate = false` you will get an unwanted result:
`video_allow_rotate = true`:
![centiped-190409-121359](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13054748/55795957-ce20fd80-5ac0-11e9-8bbc-10d01a5cf1e0.png)
`video_allow_rotate = false`:
![centiped-190409-120210](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13054748/55795769-71bdde00-5ac0-11e9-868c-f08684fff394.png)
so in this case, mame2003 is sending the core:
**width:** 240
**height:** 320
**rotation:** 1/3 (90/270 degrees)
but `video_allow_rotate = false` is saying ""I don't care about how much the emulator wants to rotate it"", so you are ending up with the game not rotated (fine), but the screen dimension are now wrong.
TATE mode was added so that it doesn't presume rotation. Ie, it instead would send:
**width:** 320
**height:** 240
**rotation:** 1/3 (90/270 degrees)
(the rotation is still sent - the presumption is that anyone with a TATE setup would also set `video_allow_rotate = false`)
![centiped-190409-122201](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13054748/55796687-7daa9f80-5ac2-11e9-9abb-dae5908ac2e9.png)
(PS, screenshots from behaviour of mame2003 from a year or so ago, and retroarch 1.3.6 - this is what i originally designed TATE mode on - someone else rewrote TATE mode in 2003 so it instead does the rotations within the core itself - personally i think it should all be handled in the front end)
so hopefully that shows the issue that TATE mode was trying to solve. IMO there's some better solutions:
1) the API lets the core find out what video_allow_rotate is set to. that way, it can send the appropriate height/width for the situation.
2) rotation of 1 (90) or 3 (270deg) also flips the height/width. this would be my preference.
i haven't really thought about the ramifications of these! :)"
2042,430055555,481215666,None,"there is also some interplay with aspect_ratio that I've forgotten the details about.

No one ever disputed that the correct resolution is 240x320 when rotated. What's being disputed is whether or not all the cores are reporting the correct resolution when the image is rotated. You really are failing to grasp what's going on, here. Numerous people have since recognized the issue I'm describing and the issue in FBA was both recognized and fixed.

The question of what the default rotation behavior should be for vertical games is almost trivial. It literally only matters the first time RA is launched, after which the user can set the behavior in the frontend. The MAIN issue is getting consistent behavior across all cores, regardless of what the default behavior should be. Now, if we're discussing the SEPARATE issue of what the default behavior should be or what is technically ""correct,"" I've already said what I'm going to say about that. You can either respond directly to the points I've made or continue ignoring them, either one is fine by me. Both standalone FBA and now also the FBA core do exactly what that they should be doing: by enabling rotation in the core options and enabling vertical mode in the quick menu core options, you get the correct image, which looks like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12267058/55835445-6b882b80-5ad9-11e9-95e5-767e36d2622c.png)"

Im not wasting more time on it with you. No offence i posted a fix details for mame2003 and plus to send this bad geometry clearly you dont understand this at a level beyond screenshots.
2046,430055555,481451616,None,As for tate mode in mame2003 and plus is a ccw 90 degree rotate (it was renamed to what it is now from that) so if the arcade is 90 or 270 it will rotate the same way if the user has there screen rotated in a barcade/ servo/ stand setup . If you want a no rotate option youll need to post a github issue to get it added. intended use for this rotation is this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dShq_reM-84 if you have the ability to do it. So a no rotate would need to have a good reason
2047,430055555,481483688,None,to sum it up its to do with core rotating an image with ra the cores info updates the rotated geom. RA doesnt like it or update geometry even when you do a manual rotate itself. So you have to return the original orientation even when you rotate through RA with the core.
2048,430055555,481484714,None,all mame cores will need updates or ra should report rotated geometry.

Yes, this is opensource, and I don't *expect* you to support libressl.

It can be because of a translation patch, an SRAM patch, and so on...
So I suggest a very simple solution :
Just add an option in playlist menu that could be named '_Ignore CRC while scanning roms_' or '_Add unknown roms to playlists_', whatever.
The thing is that it'll replace that line
`""crc32"": XXXXXXXX | crc""`
By
`DETECT`
In order to easily display all roms on playlists, with a label **taken from rom filenames**, so that roms with a good labels would display thumbnails, and roms with another label (like T-eng 100% etc...) would not display cover (it's not a big deal).
RetroArch playlists are painful to use because of those unique CRC32, and it would be wonderful to simplify it in that way !
For now, I'm creating my Playlists with _RetroArch Playlists Manager_ on Windows, to add my SRAM patched GBA roms, as well as all my non-detected translated roms.
Thanks for reading, I really hope to see that option.

Yes, but it's a small trade-off for having user friendly playlists IMO...

For the packs or on-demand downloads (https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/pull/8490) forcing filename is fine I guess.

That way on both GUIs we could have an option to link a thumbnail that is not on the thumbnails folder or isn't part of the packs.
The whole al filenames have to match convention was due to the fact that the playlist couldn't grow or store any more information because the format was hardcoded.
The new one has room to grow.
As for the OP.
I figure we could have an option that reads ""Add to playlist"" then you select a file and it would search the DBs for occurrences with that name, then the user would be able to select the best suited entry. Of course that's a lot more complex than it sounds

Why not, but it'd be a hundred time longer than manually creating playlists on a PC.

If anything what i want is the exact opposite of this feature: give a option to ignore the serials and go full crc instead of pretending that a serial is a unique id (hilariously, even if you scan something like a snes rom, you get all of its 'versions' and 'dump variants' - and maybe even hacks don't even remember but it may be worse and they simply not be there). This is hardly unique, since console makers didn't really care often about editions or bugfixes bumping serials, though as i mentioned it gets kafkaesque once hacks come into the picture. I made plenty of suggestions to both make a CRC scanner faster (only do it optionally, only do it for (cd) formats with a inbuilt crc like chd, keep a separate hack database and only check when needed, keep the crcs of cue files for the 'canonical' dump sets etc). The RA project made it clear that the scanner is a afterthought with a rather impressive number of ways it can go wrong and no interest in doing anything to get data the original dump sets didn't provide (filtering mame split sets for only the main 'rom' for instance) so i stopped caring.
¹ in fact i'm about 95% suure that last time i checked, the 'crc' on the playlist files was often bogus now, and a artifact of the old format / code using crcs but the scanner changing to serial as primary key, so you have crcs being 'found' that are completely fictitious."

RA is using serials, which lead to duplicates. It's also ditching certain emulator specific configurations of roms, lke MAME split sets (which could be supported by just taking the crc of the main game archive and pretend the others are not important). So the project decided to 'canonize' some particular sets, sometimes, and fuzzify most times.
This is still not enough to both fuzzily 'identify' certain games (games are missing), so people are asking for even more fuzzy filenames. I disagree with this because if the 'game is missing' even with serial, there is something else seriously wrong (what? Probably the scanner is dying on a untested hill somewhere on a set. Misidentifying sets of a console for another is my guess, that whole mess of scanner looking at a cd dump 'magic bytes' to find out what type of console it's supposed to be, which is not very resistant to different types of fileformat).
It's also *misidentifying* game hacks, because naturally they don't bother changing serials.
Finally, RA after getting the first entry of a game list (or the last don't recall) puts its (possibly bogus) CRC on the playlist (not certain, but probably because there are features and code that needs a crc).
Any future feature that depends on crc for uniqueness (say, web data, autoconfigs, auto tweaks, netplay) is built on quicksand."

**Describe the bug**
Currently it seems it's not possible to create relations with the Administrator model (one-way).
An example use case:
We have a plugin in which we want to create new entities of a certain type, but we also want to know which administrator created them, so we would like to save a relationship between this entity and administrator. This can be a one-way relationship, but it seems even that is not possible.
**Steps to reproduce the behavior**
1. Create a model
2. Create a relationship with administrator:
```
""created_by"": {
""model"": ""administrator"",
""plugin"": ""admin""
}
```
3. Run project
4. See error
**Expected behavior**
Ability to create relationships (even if one-way) to administrator

2095,453440611,499884619,None,"Hi,
I agree with you it would be a nice feature to have. Right now you can implement your usecase by using the user from the users-permissions plugin (I know it means having duplicates of your admins in the users) but this will at least allow you to implement until this feature is implemented somehow.
@derrickmehaffy @mdibaiee What kind of relations would you like to have ?"
2096,453440611,500028218,None,"I have a similar issue with the new way the admin is configured.
## My use case
We have an in-house, agency calendar. Users must sign in to view the calendar. The sign in authentication is handled by Strapi.
Until recently, the calendar user's roles were either Strapi 'Administrators' or Strapi 'Authenticated'. There is no 'Public' access to the calendar. Users registered via a registration link (the registration process handled by Strapi) -- and a successful, email verified registration meant you were automatically set as 'Authenticated'.
If your Strapi user role is 'authenticated', you're only able to view the calendar. If, however, your Strapi user role is 'Administrator', you're able to view the calendar as well as make edits to the calendar via the Strapi admin back-end. A unit manager would say, hey, so-and-so needs to edit the calendar as well as view the calendar. When I got this request, I manually bumped the user's role from 'Authenticated' to 'Administrator' -- and then I'd send that new 'Administrator' user a link to the Strapi admin.
The point here is that both 'Authenticated' and 'Administrator' users used the same login process -- go to the registration link on the front-end, register, verify e-mail, and then login via the ```/auth/local```. The best part of this is that the user -- no matter if she were 'Authenticated' or 'Administrator' could use the same username and password for access to the back-end Strapi admin and the front-end calendar app (written in Vue)
## What's happening now
Now, 'Administrator' roles have to be authenticated via ```/admin/auth/local``` on the front-end whereas 'Authenticated` users authenticate via ```/auth/local```.
## The issue
So the issue right now is that those admin users can't simply login to the calendar anymore. The ```/auth/local``` route won't authenticate them. They need a seperate username/password to access the Strapi backend. So they'll have two username/password combos -- one to access the Strapi back-end, another to access the 'front-end'.
## Confusion
So, I'm confused now. I'd been using the single route to login. Now there's two routes. So either I need to create sepeate usernames and passwords -- or I ask the user up front: are you an admin? Are you a user? ... and then set the auth route accordingly.
My questions:
- How can I set an 'administrator' role so that she's able to log in to the Strapi back-end and my app front-end with the same username and password?
- I no longer see the 'administrator' role in my content type user relation. So, if say, a person is a Strapi admin and an authenticated Strapi user -- their username needs to be in both the 'Admin' role as well as the 'authenticated' role in order to see it in the user-relation dropdown on a content-type (and, say, add that user to a blog post or article or whatever.)
- Even if I create a brand new custom role -- and click every box for the permissions -- that new role isn't able to access the Strapi admin. I want a simple checkbox to say, okay, can this user access the Strapi admin? If yes -- click it and grant access. That's it. That seems like the simplest solution.
I understand the desire to seperate the strapi roles from the app roles -- but in my case, and (I suspect) many others -- the roles are identical. An 'admin' is an 'admin', 'root' is 'root', 'superAdmin' is 'superAdmin' -- so she should be able to log in to the strapi backend and login to the app front-end -- all with the same username and password.
The alternative, of course, is to create a brand new back-end UI -- essentially duplicating Strapi's admin -- and granting that custom user (or 'authenticated' user) access to my custom back-end UI -- and then just using Strapi as a way to handle GET/POST requests. But this backend UI and baked-in authentication was exactly the reason why I started using Strapi in the first place. :)"
2097,453440611,500113939,None,"@alexandrebodin currently, our use case is just a one-way relationship to the administrator model.
We want our local plugins to be able to create models, which, as a metadata, include the Administrator which created them in their database record. So our table looks like this:

{
""connection"": ""default"",
""collectionName"": ""sms"",
""info"": {
""name"": ""sms"",
""description"": """"

""type"": ""date""
},
""deleted_at"": {

""type"": ""date""
}
}

If you can point me to where the code for this resides, I might be able to create a pull-request myself.
As a next step (and I can foresee this requirement), I think we potentially will want to customize the administrator model as well."

The idea is to make the `user-permissions` plugin a real `oauth` / `open id connect` server and use passportjs to allow for a lot of providers. ## Admin connection
In the same way I want the admin to use passport so people can configure it to connect to the users-permissions plugin if you want to. Use a ldap or any other passport providers.
What do you guys think about it ?"

I would like to point out that realistically Strapi should for easy customization in all aspects, this should include options for all packages as not everyone's use-case is going to follow ""the heard"", and there is going to be some niche cases. As an example extending the admin authentication to add certain password, username, email restrictions. Maybe specific password polices, the options are limitless and hence the reason I think that admin package needs to allow for this. If we are allowing users to modify the ""frontend"" of the adminUI, the backend should have the same respect.

I think having it in the UI makes sense, if I try to think of a CMS, I can always imagine it having a panel for managing admin users (WordPress does that).
I also don't see a reason not to allow _extensions_ to the admin model, services and controllers. Though one may argue that we should not be able to remove anything or modify the default attributes from the model to avoid breaking the application, and I think that makes sense.

Hi @aefox
I follow this way override the strapi-admin package for adding the relation field 'role' to the administrator model.
First, I added one field to this file:
https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/packages/strapi-admin/models/Administrator.settings.json
```
""role"": {
""plugin"": ""users-permissions"",
""model"": ""role""
}
```
Then check the create and update functions on https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/packages/strapi-admin/controllers/Admin.js
```
const { email, username, password, blocked, ...otherProps } = ctx.request.body;
...
const user = {
email: email,
username: username,
blocked: blocked === true ? true : false,
password: await strapi.admin.services.auth.hashPassword(password),
...otherProps
};
```
And it worked!

Anyway, it's an iterative process, and it's done to make the program last and become more maintainable in the long run. We cannot get there with all these separate files in their current form with all sorts of global state all over the place. And as I keep maintaining, the majority of the code outside of retroarch.c and libretro-common should become 80 to 90% tasks, thread-safe and all. Anything global has to go into one centralized place, so that we can make order out of chaos. Not to mention it's more optimal this way as well. The code outside retroarch.c should become a lot more pure, no longer relying so much on global state everywhere, so that we can convert them easier into tasks.

> Tasks are fine for certain things but are a huge headache when you need things to run in order.
Of course they are a headache, but it eventually has to happen anyway. CPUs are only getting more cores instead of faster clock speeds so allowing for stuff to be put on multiple threads at the same time is a very definite help (for things that can be done out of sequence), the main UI cannot block, many of these tasks on the main thread do block, which is bad. It's bad for Android, iOS, it's bad for the A/V synchronization timer, etc. It's bad for platforms like UWP where synchronous file I/O is very heavily penalized.

2128,457082435,502834364,None,"If it's in the name of performance, multithreading and also reducing code, it can't be that bad, all that global state had it coming anyways.
The maintainability might suffer a bit, but speaking as someone who just started contributing a few weeks ago, getting into it requires lots of debugging know-how anyways.
There's no easy ""reading into it"" (if you try starting with configuration.c, you will go bonkers), no ""it's about this, so it's probably there"" (for example: guess where the core init is called... retroarch.c? Nah, command.c), you basically only find stuff by starting with a log message and backtracking (good ol' printf debugging).
So in practical terms, putting more code in 1 place doesn't change much.

Conda works well when you want full control and full integration into your

want no muss and fuss just works install that disrupts nothing.

additional docker container that has cq already installed (via conda of

@rowanG077 yes it is indeed possible to include binary dependencies in a wheel. It is not really practical though, especially for a project with so complex dependencies. If you don't believe me, take a look inside of the wheel that the project you mentioned is providing.

@rosejn let's agree to disagree about conda. From where I sit it is not niche. There are people complaining all the time, but somehow I haven't see anyone producing a working wheel yet. It is possible, the question is if it is practical and how much time will we spend on doing it and then supporting users in debugging a zillion of issues specific to different system configurations, incompatible compilation flags of OCCT etc. If you can contribute a build pipeline (preferably azure) for generating wheels for Win, Linux and OSX that work reliably then we'll be more than happy to merge it.
You can also consider building packages for your favorite distro - no blessing from the CQ team is needed to do that.

2173,457401238,867371860,Bitter frustration,"We'd all *love* to see PyPI-hosted packages for CadQuery. No one sane is opposed to that. Unfortunately, the core issues here are all on PyPI's side: e.g.,
* [*Distributing large binary payloads as separate downloads*](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/7852).
* [*API to get dependencies without full download*](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/474).
Without significant movement from the official PyPI community on those issues (which seems unlikely, because there's no consensus as to at what the high-level solutions to those issues even are), it's unclear whether CadQuery can meaningfully do anything here.
## Explain It To Me Like I'm 28
Official Python packaging standards *basically* prevent sharing large low-level non-Python dependencies like OpenCASCADE (OCCT) and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) as binary Python wheels that can be safely reused by other Python packages. That's bad. Every Python package requiring those sorts of dependencies has to rebundle those dependencies inside *every* binary Python wheel they publish. That's even worse. PyPI has strict filesize requirements, because bandwidth funding is understandably scarce. [The CDN hosting PyPI downloads currently pays **$1.5 million USD** out-of-pocket to host those downloads](https://discuss.python.org/t/what-to-do-about-gpus-and-the-built-distributions-that-support-them), which is probably unsustainable for obvious reasons.
[The full OpenCASCADE distribution alone consumes **~1.5GB** in space](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html). Now add pywrap + OCP + CadQuery itself + {whatever-else} to that. Since that math fails to add up on my primitive abacus, it rapidly becomes clear that CadQuery won't be publishing binary PyPI wheels anytime soon — however much everyone wishes it just would.
## Can't CadQuery Just Do What Do Other Packages Do?
Different Python packages circumvent those constraints in different ways.
The CUDA-based CuPy package, for example, [laboriously publishes **one PyPI-hosted binary wheel of CuPy for each supported version of CUDA**](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html#installing-cupy). Why? Because each version of CUDA is so grotesquely big, the only way CuPy can feasibly support all supported versions of CUDA is to isolate each CUDA version to its own version-specific CuPy wheel (e.g., `cupy-cuda112` for CUDA v11.2, `cupy-cuda111` for CUDA v11.1). Of course, that's blatantly insane. It makes the `pip` constraints solver (especially with respect to `pip install --upgrade`) useless, because `pip` thinks those are completely different packages. Moreover, it requires CuPy developers to continually go to the PyPI community with their hat in their hands and politely beg for increases in their filesize allotment. Why? Because CUDA ain't gettin' any smaller, folks. At some point in the all-too near dystopian future, PyPI maintainers will be forced to refuse their polite but gluttonous requests for increased bandwidth — at which time the CuPy userbase will be quietly required to use `conda` to install CuPy. That probably sounds familiar, doesn't it?
[Other packages like `nltk` provide a crazy `download()` function that you have to manually call after installing a negligibly small PyPI-hosted `nltk` package shim to *actually* install the package properly](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/7852#issuecomment-812948919). That's probably even worse than CuPY's kludge, because it breaks idempotency <sup>*don't forget to remove that `nltk.download()` call before deploying to production, folks!*</sup>, subverts sane packaging standards, and presumably fails to sanely interoperate with `pip`-based downloads caching. The burden of installation shouldn't be on the end user; it should be on the developer.
There's actually a heated discuss that unsurprisingly went nowhere about this exact topic on both [the official Python mailing list](https://discuss.python.org/t/what-to-do-about-gpus-and-the-built-distributions-that-support-them/7125) and [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27205586). Because PyPI maintainers failed to reach a consensus agreement, the only certainty there is that PyPI (and thus `pip`) remains hostile to large binary dependencies (and thus Python packages requiring large binary dependencies).
That's us.
## So What Should CadQuery Just Do What Do Other Packages Do?
**Absolutely nothing.** The more pertinent question is: ""What should everyone *else* do?"" And the answer to that question is clear: ""Drop `pip` like hot radioactive lead.""
`pip` is great for managing pure-Python packages. `pip` is *okay* for managing non-pure-Python packages requiring small binary dependencies. `pip` is fundamentally unsuitable for managing managing non-pure-Python packages requiring large binary dependencies.
That's not going to change anytime soon... and that's not CadQuery's fault. It is what it is. :shrug:"
2174,457401238,867410048,Bitter frustration,"That's a really good explanation! Off-topic rant: Also I would say the solution (to share large binary files within pip and their bandwidth cost problem) to me seems SUPER obvious and relatively simple to implement: the PyPI folks could build a torrent client into pip and download binaries and even pure Python packages that way. At least make the torrent thing an option for large binary files, besides the current way of doing things?
It would still allow them to pay crazy amounts to host (torrent seed) downloads so they remain fast (if they wanted to) + it would allow package distributors (**and package consumers**) to host/seed binaries and python packages. This would probably greatly decrease the hosting costs for the PyPI folks as well. Anybody who would like to support Python and pip could simply download or update a torrent magnet link and start seeding. On their server, on their phone or wherever they want. Aren't these issues basically the reason why the Torrent system was invented?"

Do you believe that hosting bandwidth is somehow magically ""wasted away"" into the torrent network when you seed a torrent vs host a file the traditional way?"

No magic involved. Just human nature. People tend to seed only what they use/watch/otherwise utilize now. Few seed something for the greater good. Even fewer do it from always-on server. Because of that some obscure and old packages would be hard or impossible to download. This is what I was talking about. This is not the place to discuss this initiative. CadQuery is not PyPI. If I'm wrong you probably should pitch this idea to pip maintainers at https://discuss.python.org/"

2179,457401238,918663877,None,"FWIW, it doesn't matter to me whether cadquery hosts on PyPI/supports pip install at all or not. I think every project should support the tooling that works best for them and their users. However I just wanted to clarify/point out a few things as a PyPI maintainer/admin!
Easiest/happiest thing first.
> * [_API to get dependencies without full download_](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/474).
This is coming, we've had a rough idea of what to do for awhile now, and we were just missing someone with the free time to go through and write it up as a proper PEP. That happened and [PEP 643](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0643/) is now accepted and is currently being implemented.
> * [_Distributing large binary payloads as separate downloads_](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/7852).
This is still a problem. In the linked thread under ""heated discussion"" (which I don't think was actually heated! but that's neither here nor there) Dustin (one of the PyPI maintainers/admins with me) laid out the problem with several possible solutions. We don't have a solution to this, but I'm pretty sure that everyone involved wants to solve this problem. Right now it's stuck in the ""discuss possible ideas"" phase, largely because nobody has stepped up to write, submit, and champion a PEP for a possible solution (not that that PEP would be guaranteed to be accepted, but that's how those projects make decisions).
The Venn diagram of people who have the ""large binary"" problem, people who care/want to work on pip/PyPI, and people who have the time to work on the above is pretty small, so it'll likely languish until someone gets more time, it bubbles up to be a much larger problem, or someone external champions an idea that gets successfully accepted."

CQ-editor (and Jupyter-CadQuery) are all very nice but I'd like use a proper IDE (in my case Visual Studio) in order to better use and understand Cadquery. This has proved extremely difficult and hence, in my research, I found this thread. Sadly, even after reading everything above, I still don't have a working solution.
To increase adoption of cadquery, a key requirement is easy installation of it. That means that either installation should be a single operation or that there should be concise and clear documentation to follow (actually, there should always be such documentation).
I avoid using conda because I find it buggy, difficult to use and because it causes conflicts on my systems.

2181,457401238,927114178,None,"FYI: Last few days I've been intermittently working on my own attempt at creating **Nix flakes** for **pywrap** and **OCP** all that while learning how to do it properly. I know that there were some tries to do it but all links in this issue I've opened so far led to repositories almost 2 years old + attempts in **nixpkgs** repo seem to also have been abandoned. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
Btw. my goals are following:
- pywrap, ocp and cadquery must be easily buildable locally from source code. No hackary like repackaging conda packages! Also use normal OCCT package (of a properly tested fixed version) from *nixkgs* as a source of headers not the ones added/hardcoded into the repos as submodule.
- Package **libclang**'s missing python bindings and provide them as an **nixpkgs** overlay in a flake until it's in **nixpkgs**.
- Each project should have nix flake inside its repo. One could then directly install them using their github urls. CQ maintainers would have to be OK with it of course.
- For each project also provide a development shell inside its flake so one can just fire up VSCode/ium inside it and work on the code.
- Finally provide an exemplary devShell where CadQuery is installed so one can open open VSCode/ium or whatever editor inside it and start drawing immediately.
- Also package CQ-editor and provide an exemplary devShell with both CadQuery and CQ-editor.
So far it's going good but I'm going to have to add a parameter into **pywrap** through which one can fully specify all clang's parameters. `--include` is not sufficient since Nix does not use UNIX-like filesystem hierarchy with global libraries and everything from sysroot to libcxx include paths (`-isystem` not `-I`) have to be specified. Not to mention a possibility of crosscompilation. Those flag are calculated automatically by nixpkgs's buiild infrastructure but have to be passed in when not using clang's wrapper shell script."

What you say is misleading this is definitely provided but it involve conda. Anyway I see several solutions : 1. Install miniconda, this avoid most of the burden of Anaconda while retaining the easy install of binary package anaconda provides ( You can also look at mamba and micromamba that can also be a good replacement)
2. CQ-editor and jupyter-cadquery allow you to use an external editor, CQ-editor can refresh the view when you save a file (that can be outside the editor) jupyter-cadquery as a external viewer that run in your browser and gets updated when you call the show function in your script.
3. You can build OCP and the others cq dependencies from source but that would be a pain

One thing I might try experiment with if I get time is the use of https://github.com/conda/constructor
The idea being you'd have 3 ways to install things
* The first being the usual way via conda
* The second being via a installable exe / bundle created with constructor (standalone install) with everything including cadquery included.
* The third being similar to approach two but just bundling the C++ dependencies cadquery needs, then installing cadquery / any python depends via pip. Then you'd just need some way for cadquery to find the installed binary libs / blobs, probably via an environment variable or something
Approach 2 would be the easiest / quickest for a windows install
Approach 3 would be best if you wanted to use a newer / local version of python
In theory it wouldn't be idea as you'd need to manually update the libs whenever cadquery was updated, but it would avoid issues with conda / miniconda installs for those that are non technical.
Also it may be possible to set this up via github workflows so that things are auto generated on new version tags."

The approach I've taken so far which seems to work fairly well under windows
Is install miniconda, untick any option for adding to the path etc to avoid it overriding an existing python install
Launch the Aconda shelll
```
# Update conda
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
# change directory to some place to install
cd C:\Apps\
# create a virtual conda environment
conda create -p cadquery

The [development packages](https://github.com/jmwright/CQ-editor/actions?query=workflow%3Abuild) mentioned in the [CQ-editor readme](https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor#development-packages) are based on the current master branch, are built weekly automatically, and can be built on-demand when the community wants/needs it.

The Windows packages include a CQ-editor.exe file. The top level of the packages has a Windows command line script instead of the exe for two reasons.
1. Users didn't like searching through the CQ-editor directory to find the executable.
2. In some cases it's helpful to set environment variables before the exe is called.
We also have the capability of building a monolithic exe file, but the startup times for that format can be glacial."
2195,457401238,1032890519,None,"I'd like to address some of practical points brought up in the rant(s) above, because they don't really make sense to me. It feels more like people arguing over vim & emacs rather than trying to come to a good solution to empower a community. I'm curious about a couple practical matters brought up here.
First, regarding the distribution of pre-compiled binaries. Who cares about making OCCT/OCP being available as a low-level dependency to other projects? That's not what the goal is here. Just package it up and make it part of cadquery, and if people want to use it like a library they can always depend on cadquery. I just checked, and the cadquery source itself is less than 600k, so this isn't a big deal at all. Many other python bindings to C (and C++) projects do exactly this, like tensorflow. As an alternative, the OCCT+OCP component could be packaged as a tarball, .deb, homebrew, etc., and then this would be installed separately before pip installing cadquery. In the same way that we need to download and install CUDA and CUDNN from nvidia before using tensorflow, this is a pattern that works just fine.
Second, the file size issue... is this really an issue? I just built opencascade 7.5 and the compiled libs + include headers are about 100 MB. I'm curious how this could become 1.5 GB with the addition of ""thin"" python wrappers, and whether all of the modules are even required. Maybe some of the challenge can be simplified by pruning the build output so that the end result is more manageable?
Last, as a final option, the NLTK example given above which requires a download() call (which means the size is irrelevant because it can just download from a github release link) sounds quite practical. What are the drawbacks of this approach for users? Clearly by the many people who care about this issue Conda is a constant source of pain, and in some cases just isn't an option. That download call can just look in .local/lib/CadQuery to see if it's installed already, and if not download it. This is simple, easy to verify, and not error prone. CadQuery is primarily a user tool, not something that will be deployed, but even if it is that could be setup in a dockerfile and done once on build, which is how most deployments happen these days anyways.
My prediction is that once cadquery is easily installable via pip so people can read a blog post and try it out in a moment of curiosity the user base, interest, projects and tools built using cadquery will all increase."
2196,457401238,1032908753,None,"To begin with, I care about making OCP available as a package and about having sane binary dependency management for CQ. Everything you write is possible, but to me sounds like a hacky workaround (especially the NLTK example you give). Conda offers the best effort to result ratio for delivering something working and a huge number of relevant native packages that are (or could be) used by CQ. For some reasons some people hate it, but so far no one opened a PR with a clean pipeline building a wheel. If you don't want to spend time installing a portable conda distro, why would I spend time on building a hacky pip package? Given limited resources, it is more interesting and productive to develop new features.

- Much more important issue is **global mutable state**:
Python's **venv** downloads everything into a folder inside your project (people usually use `.venv/` name) and does NOT modify anything outside of it and it is completely movable.
**(Mini)Conda** on the other hand assumes with insolence that you have an accessible home folder then downloads everything there and references/uses it from your project. It is detached from your project, cannot be moved with your project and leaves garbage for you to clean up from your home when you are done with the project.

In conda you can create as many environments as you like. Same as with venv. And you can remove them as soon as you are done with the project. Same as with venv. It is not worse than python + venv and not harder to manage. It is just different and takes some getting used to."

To me, it is a bug. The feature of being able to use negative padding has been broken.

puts ""warning: pagination padding is negative""

We would like a negative padding feature that consistently works with different databases and paginatable arrays.
Keep in mind that PostgreSQL and MySQL do not accept negative `OFFSET` values and SQLite just ignores it. We would also have to ensure compatibility with the built-in paginatable array and `kaminari-mongoid` if possible. The intension of raising an error is to prevent people from running into inconsistent behaviour (see [this comment for more details](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari/issues/839#issuecomment-268211318))."

The reason we're dropping negative padding is not because we want to break your app (of course!) but because we couldn't implement a consistent and predictable behavior for that feature.
We understand that some previous versions of kaminari were luckily working on your app as you expected, but that same app may behave differently on a different setup. We don't want to ship such a fragile thing as our public API.
Kaminari is an abstraction layer for those who don't want to calculate and manipulate complex pagination logic. Or maybe we can call it a DSL.
We believe that a library for such purpose should never include something that behaves unpredictably. That is why we're carefully testing our code base against multiple versions of ruby, rails, and multiple kinds of database engines.
There are reasons behind APIs. And the reasons are written in the tests (and commit comments / discussions). We maintain tests so that we can make sure we're properly providing what we've designed.
So, when you're proposing to change an existing behavior, you will need to reflect your new design in the tests and make them all green for all test matrix.

2263,494492439,494492439,None,"Currently it is not possible to mount a filesystem to a mount point that contains blanks.
There are many problems in the ``states.mount.mounted`` code path, e.g. the mount command arguments are not quoted in the ``modules.mount.mount`` function, see https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/mount.py#L1237. Code should look like this IMO:
```
cmd = 'mount {0} {1} {2} '.format(args, device, shlex.quote(name))
```
But this will fix only a small piece of the whole problem.
Another one is that ``states.mount.mounted`` does not detect correctly that the filesystem might be mounted already, i think it's because the key in the active table is not unquoted, so a comparison between
``/srv/dev-disk-by-label-My\040Passport\040Blue`` and the specified ``/srv/dev-disk-by-label-My Passport Blue`` fails.
To me it looks like the whole mount state and module is not able to handle blanks in device names and mount points properly.

mount_fs_with_label:
mount.mounted:

- device: ""/dev/disk/by-label/My\\x20Passport\\x20Blue""

2264,494492439,808843192,None,"Hello, @votdev I am trying to build myself home NAS with old Atom mini-ITX board... So i install OMV5, i plug in dad's old NTFS drive... and here we go...
Frankly, i wish Salt guys put the comments inside this source, listing all the bugs related to this module. So any hacker which for whatever reason would change it - would be instantly notifie on old pending bugs.
Salt seems extremely fragile here, probably no one else except for OMV5 uses it for partitions. Maybe OMV6 could do it outside Salt? Like good old UDEV rules or anything. I mean, before Salt porject might decide to drop this functionality that almost no one use, instead of burden of maintaining it for OMV5 alone....
Well, ranting aside, i am rather puzzled with your _device: ""/dev/disk/by-label/My\\x20Passport\\x20Blue""_
Where do you even get this hex substitution from???
Thing is, the whole mounting escaping is one uber-ancient legacy mess. Putting it here so maybe someone would use it. I spent like 3 hours googling around and experimenting with Python that i never used before. Tryied to google some standard about Posix/Linux/bash filename mangling/escaping.... and then Python module to undo it. To no avail.
Okay, so, to document it down.
- mtab/fstab and friends is one-of-a-kind ancient mess.
- it started with ancient BSD (not FreeBSD) function strunvis, which behaviour not documented. Probably that was OS-specific function (a la virtual methods). http://manpages.org/strunvis/3
- when Linux was mimicking good old BSd it only made ad hoc substitutions for 4 specific chars. There is no any systematic/generic pattern at all.
```
static inline void mangle(struct seq_file *m, const char *s)
{
seq_escape(m, s, "" \t\n\\"");
}
```
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/fs/proc_namespace.c#L84
```
R(""\\"", '\\'),
R(""011"", '\t'),
R(""012"", '\n'),
R(""040"", ' '),
R(""134"", '\\')
```
https://sources.debian.org/src/sysvinit/2.96-6/src/fstab-decode.c/
So, whatever comes from Linux mounts information - should be de-mangled for those four special cases.
Every single space-separated column of every single line.
Ugly, and undocumented, but that is what it is. And, frankly, it is not that hard...
BUT, why do you want to compare with some arbitrary hex-escaped string? what can be a real use-case for that???
Linux kernel just does not have hex-escaping code for disk mounts.
Now, to be frank, even this would NOT be enough, because i can have multiple disks with the same partition label. Like many USB thumb drives with ""DATA"" partition. I can even have several partitions with the same name on singe disk!
Again, it can be fixed by detecting collisions and adding extra data, like counters or GUID or whatever, but...
What gonna OMV do if OMV's user has two drives with partitions having same labels, and then he hotplugs one disk, or another, or both in any order? Is it race condition now? Is it okay for OMV to have race condition?
Seems whatever use cases Salt imagined for them here is very different from what OMV users might face."

2266,494492439,808854580,None,"@votdev re: escaping names for calling `mount` - i think that is what was intended to do so:
`""device"": device_name.replace(""\\040"", ""\\ ""),` inside `def _active_mountinfo()`
but that was only called when from `def active(extended=False)` then Extended is set to True, if ever
And similar code inside `def _resolve_user_group_names(opts):`
So it seems Salt prefers to keep space-containing names mangled, but mangled differently.
So, no escaping when calling `mount` or `umount` is needed,
---
I am not even sure that de-escaping mount point likes `xxx\040yyy` in Salt would be correct way to go.
There can be a point: since that module serves as abstraction layer and should hide UNIX-likes peculiarities from generic Salt modules, all IDs better be unmangled. But not sure. However IF to do this de-mangling, then quoting arguments for calling `mount` becomes required indeed.
But anyway, this line i believe should not had ended in /etc/fstab and whoever added it was at fault...

I am coming to believe that, while never documented, the intention of that Salt module was to always use fstab-like escaped strings for all their IDs. If not, i would like to see specific calls into other Salt modules, which expect different convention for disk names.
I really did quite a number of changes to de-escape \040 and other special chars. And probably that was only breaking things.

Would you keep implementation non-patched and would you call `salt-call mount.list_mounts` - you would see the mount point broken, cut off on the first space. This was probably THE bug.

```
So, it is UDEV or SYSTEMD which creates those weird hex-mangled names. Okay. Though putting them into /etc/fstab still feels wrong. `man mount` suggests against it and suggests using `UUID=...` and `LABEL=...` flags instead.
Now back to your
```
Example SLS:
mount_fs_with_label:
mount.mounted:
- name: ""/srv/dev-disk-by-label-My Passport Blue""
```
I don't know what it should mean in specific files/commands terms. But i feel this is the error on OMV part. And perhaps lack of documentation/understanding/forecasting on Salt part.
```
def mount(
name, device=False, mkmnt=False, fstype="""", opts=""defaults"", user=None, util=""mount""
):
.....
salt '*' mount.mount /mnt/foo /dev/sdz1 True
.....
if device:
cmd += ""{} {} {} "".format(args, device, name)
else:
cmd += ""{} "".format(name)
```
My inner archeologist says that the `name` AKA mount point AKA target directory is meant to be in bash-mangled format.
IOW OMV should had created ""\ "" containing fileneames:
```
mount.mounted:
- name: ""/srv/dev-disk-by-label-My\ Passport\ Blue""
```
Linux `man mount` also suggests against the second option due to ambiguity, where the single parameter is mount point name or device file name. I don't know if other UNIX-likes but Linux support those precision keys.
```
--source device
If only one argument for the mount command is given then the
argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source
(device). This option allows to explicitly define that the
argument is the mount source.
--target directory
If only one argument for the mount command is given then the
argument might be interpreted as target (mountpoint) or source
(device). This option allows to explicitly define that the
argument is the mount target.
```
So i think that part in `def mount` should better be written as
```
if device:
cmd += ""{} {} {} "".format(args, device, name)
else:
if __grains__[""kernel""] == ""Linux"":
cmd += ""--target ""
cmd += ""{} "".format(name)

Escaping blanks is not my idea, it is used by every userland command that processes mount points, e.g. `mount`.
Either `systemd` want to have escaped paths in mount units too, there is a special command to convert
paths for you, see `systemd-escape`.

OMV already workarounds this issue, thus it is not affected by this reported issue here.

I don't think Salt will drop `mount.mounted` because it is a somewhat essential functionality of Linux systems.

You can do that, but don't blame the software then. Using USB devices in a NAS is no good idea, but that's a different thing. IMO devices using in a NAS should be already connected to the NAS, no plug-and-play, this is not how a NAS is intended to work. If devices are always connected, then you will never run into the situation that duplicate labels might harm your system. This issue is user introduced and should be handled by them.
If you want to discuss this issue please open an issue in the OMV Git repository."

You still try to push Salt to adhere to OMV data format, while common sense says it should be otherwise.
Salt users would not suffer from it. OMV users would.
Demanding PR from OMV users like me is funny when you did not make any PR to Salt, or maybe i am wrong and you did.

Because that woul be consistent with bash/Salt data format. But i alreeady said it was kneejerk impulse, so you eems to be crashing through door wide open.
> The function is doing exactly what you are suggesting, keep data raw/verbatim/unescaped within OMV
Some we are on the same page here. You blaze of ego is called for.
Since eysterday i was asking you to show me at the se
ems between OMV and Salt, the exact borderleines, didn't i?
I am glad you seem to did so above, https://github.com/openmediavault/openmediavault/issues/566#issuecomment-809529126
And when i showed those links, i commented upon them.
`Salt is based on Python, not PHP. The code you're ranting about never runs in the Salt context.`
I never said so. Both Salt and OMV are ""black boxes"" with some data exchange. And i was asking you to point me to the raw places of exchange and raw data being exchanged, didn't i?
Yesterday i spent hours looking into Salt code and patching it along your suggestions.
First i took your suggestions as correct and thought through. And just followed them. An then had to undo it all.
Now you imply it was your time wasted not mine.
That `Example SLS:` - many times from yesterday i asked you how can i reproduice this activity from bash command line.
For example above - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/54508#issuecomment-808875885
You kind of answered by showing PHP code for SLS generation - after many requests and hours.
But you still not answered how to trigger that action from bash.
I asked you yesterday how to make OMV code trigger that action of Salt, allegedly buggy Salt.
And you refused to help me doing it.
https://github.com/openmediavault/openmediavault/issues/566#issuecomment-808955077

What can i patch in OMV5 to make this notification gone?
Why do you want to know that? What do you expect to improve?
```
You made me look into Linux kernel i am not familiar with, at the same time you are not very willing to point me to specific OMV code and Salt commands you are familiar with.
You are blocking any attempt to debug OMV and Salt interaction - and you demand perfectly polished PRs. It is not consistent. And it is would not help anyone. Not me, not you, not OMV users."

If a task fails or is removed while the client is shutdown, the client should be able to garbage collect any of its dangling resources (like alloc dirs) and restart the task. This is not happening with iptables.
Fortunately we ""tag"" all the iptables rules in one of two ways:
- Placing them in a chain named `CNI-xxxx`/`CNI-DN-xxxx`. I don't know what that `xxxx` is but it's not the alloc ID, container ID, or network namespace ID.
- Adding a comment in the form ` /* name: ""nomad"" id: ""<alloc ID>"" *`.
So it should be possible to identify ""Nomad owned"" rules and clean them up if they don't belong to an allocation we know about if we can figure out the naming for the CNI chains.

Nomad v0.10.0-dev (e2761807a346c5e3afd577b7994cfc788700bb15+CHANGES)
```
(But probably any recent version.)
### Reproduction steps
1. Run Nomad under systemd.
2. Run our Consul Connect demo job: `nomad job run ./e2e/connect/input/demo.nomad`
3. Stop the job: `nomad job stop countdash`
4. Observe that the tasks and iptables are cleaned up properly.
- `docker ps`
- `sudo iptables -t nat -L -v -n`
5. Run the job again: `nomad job run ./e2e/connect/input/demo.nomad`
6. Stop the Nomad client with `sudo systemctl stop nomad`.
7. Observe that the tasks and iptables are still in place.
- `docker ps`
- `sudo iptables -t nat -L -v -n`
8. Remove the tasks: `docker rm -f $(docker ps -a)`
9. Restart Nomad: `sudo systemctl start nomad`
10. Observe that the tasks are started: `docker ps`
11. Stop the job cleanly: `nomad job stop countdash`
12. Observe that iptables are left behind: `sudo iptables -t nat -L -v -n`

2279,498868764,540137667,None,"Summary of the investigation at this point:
* When the client restarts, the network hook's `Prerun` fires and tries to recreate the network and setup the iptables via CNI.
* This fails because the netns already exists, as expected. So we tear down the task and start over.
* But in the next pass when we setup the iptables via CNI, we collide with the iptables left behind.
* To fix this we need the network namespace path (which is used by CNI as part of the handle for [`go-cni#Network.Remove`](https://godoc.org/github.com/containerd/go-cni#Network.Remove)).
* In the non-Docker case, Nomad controls the path to the netns and it's derived from the alloc ID, but in the Docker case (which includes all cases with Connect integration b/c of the Envoy container), Docker owns that path and derives it from the pause container name. So we can't use a deterministic name as a handle to clean up. But we can't get it from Docker either because at the point we need it that container has already been removed.
I've verified the following more common failure modes are handled correctly:
* Tasks recover fully when the client restarts (after a few PRs we landed in the current 0.10.0 release branch)
* There's no resource leak when the client restarts if the containers aren't removed.
* There's no resource leak when the client restarts as part of a node (machine) reboot.
Status:
* We could try to fix this by threading state about the network namespace from the allocation runner back into the state store, similar to how we deal with deployment health state. But this will always be subject to races between client failures and state syncs.
* We already have a PR open for 0.10.x to reconcile and GC Docker containers. Because all the rules we're creating are tagged with the string ""nomad"" and Nomad's alloc IDs, we can make a similar loop for iptable GC.
* Because I've verified that this leak doesn't happen in the common failure modes of a client or node reboot, we're not going to block the 0.10.0 release on this. We'll work up a PR for an out-of-band reconcile loop for 0.10.x.
Moving this issue out of the 0.10.0 milestone."

In the above example, `416a88b0-76fa-e270-6c80-7f102216ca13` was removed while `aace5b7e-8e97-43d4-5705-06a94f326aee` is a new allocation. Clients of the service will get an error `Unable to establish connection to 10.133.67.138:23674` while trying to send requests to the running allocation. Even though we almost always drain nodes before manual nomad restart, sometimes nomad gets restarted automatically by systemd due to consul failure or other reasons, in which case we'd end up having stale iptables rules. So it'd be great if the iptables rule reconciliation can be implemented. 🙏 🤞"
2283,498868764,934436245,None,"I'm seeing a slightly different trigger of this issue, but with the same root cause and end results. We use puppet to manage some iptables rules on the host[0]. When puppet makes a ruleset change, it triggers the new ruleset to be persisted (on EL, that's via iptables-save to `/etc/sysconfig/iptables`). This saved ruleset includes all the permanent rules we're managing via puppet, but also all the ""transient"" rules installed by nomad/cni plugins. Therefore the next time the ruleset is loaded (e.g. after host reboot), the iptables chains are pre-filled with stale rules from historic tasks. Currently nothing is cleaning those up, and since nomad is appending new rules, the saved rules are higher up in the NAT chains. This is causing particular pain where our ingress containers which listen on static ports 80, 443 get caught in the cached ruleset, because then after a reboot, the NAT rules redirect the traffic to a blackhole instead of the running ingress container. It also affects tasks that don't use static port numbers, but then the pain is deferred to when the port eventually gets reused and is harder to track down.
This is on nomad 1.1.5.
[0] One of the rules we're managing is `-A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP` to drop packets which the conntrack module thinks are not valid, will not apply NAT. The kernel treats these as unsolicited packets, returning a TCP-RST. This tears down the connection between the container and the external service, causing disruption. There seem to be quite a few bug reports about this relating to docker, kubernetes etc, and this rule is the widely accepted workaround."
2284,498868764,974046409,None,"I've just re-read the upgrade guide for (in preparation for 1.2.0), and I think the changes in that 1.1.0 to append the CNI rules rather than insert at the top of the chain is what made this issue more noticeable (https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/pull/10181). Previously, had transient rules been persisted, the next time an alloc was started, the new iptables rules would be inserted above the stale ones and thus take precedence. Now they are added below the stale rules, so traffic is matched and blackholed by the stale rules."
2285,498868764,1019846399,None,"As noted in #11901, this affects us quite badly right now (though we're using nftables as opposed to iptables, the issue and result is the same). Whenever an unclean stop or agent restart has occurred for a job with static ports, those ports will (silently, no errors, local checks seem to succeed) fail to bind again until reboot or stale rules are manually removed.
While at first glance it looked like this was a regression caused by the priority-inversion in #10181 (as noted by @optiz0r ), that PR looks concerned only with the with `NOMAD-ADMIN` chain while in our case the issue is with stale rules blackholing dports under the `CNI-HOSTPORT-DNAT` chain (or maybe they're indeed the same after CNI does its magic?)."
2286,498868764,1145133872,None,"This is becoming a major security and stability issue as we are seeing allocations try to forward from ports that already have rules in iptables, and requests bound for them are getting forwarded based on the stale iptables rule.
Is there anything we can do to ensure this gets prioritized? Or can someone share a cleanup script they have been using?
Here is the error log around the time it fails to cleanup the stale allocation:

2287,498868764,1165846957,None,"Hit this same issue today. Performed some manual iptables clean up on a problem client. Here are my notes in case this helps anyone else:
* Seems likely it was caused by some combination of quick nomad job allocation stop and re-deployment and/or nomad systemd service restarts, possibly before cleanup of a stopped allocation could be cleaned up.
* Symptom first noticed indicitive of a problem was of failed consul healthcheck, where the port that should be the listener on the host level and is properly bridged into the container as seen from the Nomad UI and nomad job config just isn't working.
* Tcpdump on the client machine to the port listener which doesn't appear to work shows SYN packet sent to a nomad bridge IP (`[S]`) and a RESET packet immediately returned (`[R.]`)
* Looking at the tcpdump output shows that the packet is actually being sent to the wrong nomad bridge IP, and further looking at the IP tables, shows that there are duplicate (or more) rules set up for port forwarding the listener into the Nomad bridge due to unclean allocation handling of an old allocation.
* On our OS, cleaning up the iptables can be done with a client reboot, but cleaning up by hand in these occurrences can be also be done.
* General procedure -- check iptables (command refs below). There will be iptables entries which show comments of allocation ID association. Check for non-existent allocation IDs being present and/or conflicting with existing allocation iptables rules. If such allocation IDs are seen, they will also be seen to be associated with user defined iptables chains starting with CNI-[a-f0-9] and CNI-DN-[a-f0-9].

```
# In this case, old rules from a nomad bridge IP with no active allocation superseded the correct rules to a nomad bridge IP with an active allocation listener.

have a radius server as part of its back office services. For me, I
thought we had started a dialogue with my first problem, I acted on your
advice, reloaded linux, installed myql, tried to build freeradius and
there was a different kind of failure. In my view a failure of this kind
is usually a failure in the software, either configuration or build. As
such it was right to refer it back to the development team rather than
post to a users mailing list. I will not be doing this. I will fix the
problem myself or go to a different package. I will detach now. Best wishes with your excellent freeradius which I first found out about

2301,503273161,539459127,Bitter frustration,"It's really quite simple. Your original issue was because you installed OpenSSL 0.9.7. A version which was first released in 2002. If you read _any_ of the documentation about that release, it all says ""do not use it or install it"". That issue was compounded by being unable to diagnose simple build issues. I was able to diagnose the issue with minimal information. Because that issue is extremely common, and trivial to debug and fix.
The next issue was to open another GitHub issue about more build errors. Not only that, but the logs you posted above were *truncated*. i.e. they showed absolutely nothing about any build errors. This failure made the issue entirely useless. It amounts to you opening the issue and saying _Stuff went wrong, but I'm not going to tell you what went wrong. Please fix it._

Yes. Not to be rude but I have stopped all of my app development with Avalonia simply because there is basic functionality that remains broken for years because new features or ""compatibility"" is favored over deprecating or changing things for the better. I like Microsoft, and their acquisition of things usually makes things better, but this workflow I'm describing benefits nobody and it just stalls development for everyone for years.
Most of my bugs were filed in 2017-2019 and they still remain for the most part. I didn't even make reports for everything because they are so infuriating, or making a reproduction is just so time-consuming, or the issue is SO BASIC (ComboBoxes drive me insane in this) that I'm like ""surely they will find and fix this without my report"" so I just gave up. Whenever I NEED to update my stuff I end up spending the entire day diagnosing things that broke when updating (so the compatibility argument makes literally no sense since shit breaks anyway EVERY update without fail).
I have janky extension methods and fixes everywhere in every app because again, basic functionality just does not work and I'm waiting for things to get fixed, or events fire in different orders between updates. It's just impossible to justify my day doing this literally every time. I'm glad there is a ContainsExclusive now as I suggested in my PR but it should be used where possible ASAP. Not in 8 months. Then I can remove my extension method that does that in PointerPressed.
And people using my apps understand I have no motivation because of this. They see it's open source and want to help, then attempt to and go ""oh Avalonia with their 1000+ issues"" and try to port my stuff to GTK or something else since they also have issues with Avalonia. Again I don't want to be mean here but this is actual feedback you should consider seriously. You guys do hard work but the workflow is just not there where it matters. It's the hard truth and I wish it weren't since Avalonia can be so great, and should've been great a long time ago. But when ComboBoxes for example STILL don't perform as expected after 5+ years it really does hurt your users.
I pull every commit locally since I first found Avalonia, even to this day, and I read them all. But I see only new features and macOS low-level window fixes. Nothing that matters to me personally, and I get disappointed every now and then since I see the priorities. Anyway, that's just my rant and my opinion. I hope this new generation of users can develop with less headache than I did."
2314,510675125,510675125,None,"## Current behaviour
`composer.json`:
```json
""config"": {},
""autoload"": {
""psr-4"": {
""MyApp\\"": ""src/php/MyApp/""
}
},
```
Gives the following `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php`:
```php
<?php
// autoload_psr4.php @generated by Composer
$vendorDir = dirname(dirname(__FILE__));
$baseDir = dirname($vendorDir);
return array(
'MyApp\\' => array($baseDir . '/src/php/MyApp')
);
```
## Proposed behaviour
`composer.json`:
```json
""config"": {
""autoloader-root-dir"": ""src/php/""
},
""autoload"": {
""psr-4"": {
""MyApp\\"": ""MyApp/""
}
},
```
Would give the following `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php`:
```php
<?php
// autoload_psr4.php @generated by Composer
$vendorDir = dirname(dirname(__FILE__));
$baseDir = dirname($vendorDir);
return array(
'MyApp\\' => array($baseDir . '/MyApp')
);
```
I.e. the generated file would look *as if* `composer.json` were in the `src/php/` directory. Only descending the folder tree would be allowed, so you cannot do something like `""autoloader-root-dir"": ""../somewhereElse/""`. The name `autoloader-root-dir` is tentative.
## Motivation
### Built applications
In modern web development, codebases quite often use multiple languages, some of them compiled (typically something akin to TypeScript compiled to JavaScript). This means that the final application needs to be built. To cleanly separate the source files from the build artifacts, one would want to place all the source files into one directory (e. g. `src`) and have the built app in another one (e. g. `dist`). However, the `composer.json` file would typically be in the root of the repository - that is, *not* in the `src` folder. Under the current behaviour, there is no way to do this, not have the final php files somewhere like `dist/src/` and have a working autoloader. This RFC would enable that by setting `""autoloader-root-dir"": ""src/""`.
### Separating configuration files from the application itself
When an app is deployed, sometimes it is undesirable to deploy configuration files such as `.travis-ci.yml` or similar. With this RFC, one could put the actual application in a dedicated directory (e. g. `app/`), keep all the configuration files (including `composer.json`) in the root of the repo and still have a working autoloader by setting `""vendor-dir"": ""app/vendor""` and `""autoloader-root-dir"": ""app/""`.
This issue is a continuation of the recent debate in #5198. I would be willing to take a try at a PR, if the feature is deemed appropriate for inclusion in composer."
2315,510675125,544980563,None,"For PHP 5.6+, the relevant file for the autoloader is not `autoload_psr4.php` but `autoload_static.php` which makes such that no variables are ever used in the config array so that the array of paths can stay in the OPCache shared memory.

I've tried it and can confirm that that works. That leaves the first issue which I would like to solve
I have a git repo of the following:
```
├── composer.php
├── src
│ ├── php
│ │ ├── index.php
│ │ └── MyApp
│ │ └── MyClass.php
│ └── js
│ └── ...
├── vendor
└── ...
```
I would like to create (with any build system, I don't really care) a `dist` directory which I could upload to a webhosting (it being a build artifact as @alcohol pointed out). I imagined it being of the sort:
```
├── index.php
├── MyApp
│ └── MyClass.php
├── js
└── ...
└── vendor
└── ...
```
But, by now, the path from `vendor/composer/autoload_static.php` to `MyApp/MyClass.php` has changed. So the autoloading would no longer work. But with the proposed new config parameter, I could set ```json
""config"": {
""autoloader-root-dir"": ""src/php/""
}
```
and then autoloading would work in the build artifact directory.
Why not just use `vendor-dir` then? Because that would require me putting the `vendor` dir in `src/php`. But the `vendor` dir **is not** source code for me - therefore, I wouldn't want it in the `src` directory.
Clearer now? I think the exact organization of the `dist` directory could be different a bit, but the overall idea would stay the same. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this."

`NaN` values is an app level problem from our point of view since the user is in some sense the data producer. Geometric data like position, normal or color data are meant to be numerical. `NaN` data are no numerical data.
Handling `NaN` values is use case specific since proper default values depend on what the application actually does.

Currently you can enable multiple languages and can also prefer some over the other, but sonarr will ignore the prefered language if there is a better quality in another language.

- preventing downgrades of the language in order to upgrade the quality.

2374,522727008,905340928,None,"@bakerboy448 @markus101 I understand metooing isn't the solution but please also understand that you guys are kinda only focused on the use case for English speakers. It has been the same with Sonarr v2 and I ended up having to recompile a forked version of Sonarr so it could search for different languages properly (there was even a PR lying around that never got merged because it was being fixed in v3).
This is not a support request, this is a feature request that has been demanded many times. The decision you guys have made about quality over language makes no difference for anyone with only one language and it simply doesn't work for users with multiple ones: if you only have one language (i.e. English speakers) it won't matter if language comes first in the comparison as there's nothing to compare. On the other hand, if you have multiple languages, it makes sense that you prefer the cutoff ones over the rest. This would automatically implement the ""Prevent downgrading language during quality upgrade"" just by changing the order on the list of decisions you are applying. It's worth mentioning that the prevention mechanisms on their own won't solve much either as, for the first automated download, the highest quality language will be picked up, potentially never grabbing a release on the preferred language, so there wouldn't be any language downgrading.
In addition, the proposed workaround with quality groups is flaky, hacky, and it doesn't seem to work for all cases as using preferred words for quality selection is very verbose and seems error-prone (Sonarr has quite some logic to get that right). All we are asking is for a mechanism of inverting the order of these two lines: https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr/blob/develop/src/NzbDrone.Core/DecisionEngine/DownloadDecisionComparer.cs#L31-L32

Did you try? I dont try to _bypass_ anything i try to use _prefer_ language, which is not working. It does not prefer a language, it prefers the quality. Only if quality atleast match it will prefer the language.
The only working solution would be to only grab the worst quality and hope that its always in both languages available.

Fixing something that is broken does not constitute a BC break, because the specification does not change. If somebody has depended on _implementation_, instead of the specification, then they had made a mistake, and it is up to them to fix it. RFC3339 supports optional fraction, and if I made an expression that does not cater for that, then my expression does not support the RFC3339 standard.

2407,528942466,528942466,None,"First off, I love Chocolate Doom and how accurate and true it is to the original executables - right down to bugs.
Though one particular aspect that I feel may be good to be able to alter is the static limits of the engine, such as the visplane limits. Preferably this could be done as an extra command line argument or configuration setting. When not specified, the normal limit values can be used as a default.
These limits in the engine have no real affect on how the game is actually _played_, so I feel providing an optional way to adjust them would still be true to the _vanilla experience_ and not go against the philosophy of the project. It's akin to how all the networking changes _aren't_ 'true to the original' Doom, or how the Vanilla Save Game Limit or Vanilla Demo Limit are already optional changes you can make. All these changes are to give the _vanilla experience_ a greater range of access, just as they are all equally not 'true' and are not 'pure' to the original.
To make the code change as minimal as possible, it could be as simple as specifying numbers for the limits (i.e. visplane array size). One could simply set them to high values in order to run more intensive maps. Another possible and more elegant solution could be letting Chocolate Doom read the map data and set the array limits dynamically at map load time to match what is present.
I'm sure I'm not the only one who would love to use Chocolate Doom for SiGiL and other maps that are otherwise only incompatible due to these hard coded limits. It's quite annoying juggling multiple ports solely because of this single aspect alone, especially that it doesn't affect the _vanilla experience_ in any way - or at least much less so than the changes already put in and present in Chocolate Doom."

I thought it would be self explanatory... but just open up Crispy and refer to the multiple pages of options.

Let me reiterate pillar 2 and what I said about it above. It makes it very unclear why this optional limit raise would be disallowed, as it falls directly within the pillar's requirements (or at least to the same degree the vanilla demo and save file breaking already allowed in Chocolate).

That seems to fall precisely under that tier, does it not? :\ This is why I'm confused by you stating it is 'beyond the scope'.
And if it is trying to be a research project specifically aimed to be most compatible, why do you allow breaking of vanilla limits for demos and save files then? That completely destroys the point to selectively allow non compatible aspects but not others.
If you allow for setting the array sizes of the static limits, you could allow raising limits while changing virtually nothing but a #define into a variable set by command line. If the values are left as default values, then you will have _exactly, 100%_ the same vanilla behavior. This would not change compatibility whatsoever, unless you _specifically_ tell it to do so - just as you can do with vanilla breaking save and demos Chocolate can produce. So my main question is, what is the defining difference between that vanilla breaking aspect and this proposed one when they are all optional and don't actually affect even how it crashes when disabled?"

Still will be 100% vanilla compatible and would be able to test 100% compatibility with vanilla map limits with the implementation I'm doing. Was sort of hoping I wouldn't need to do that, but it's apparent now that there really is just arbitrary lines drawn on what vanilla features are allowed to be optionally broken or not in Chocolate; and trying to find reason or explanation to this has gotten me nowhere.

Hi @HollowedEmpire, I appreciate you feel really strongly about this. You aren't the first to ask for this feature and the decision was made some time ago. Maybe I can help to bring some clarity about the rationale.
I'd draw your attention to a contradiction that you've made yourself here in your comments - not because I'm trying to criticize, but just because it helps illustrate my point. You say that you dislike the fact that Crispy Doom has ""multiple pages of options"" and yet what you are asking for is another option for Choco (probably multiple options, because Vanilla Doom has many different limits).
I'm inferring from what you say that what you like about Choco is the fact that it has a sparse, minimalist set of options, and this is not a coincidence. It's a consequence of the fact that the project has a deliberately restrictive, minimalist philosophy that is intentionally designed to reject most feature requests. I made a technical decision when starting the project - it isn't going to play every Doom map ever made - and I've stuck with it.
Your request is perfectly reasonable in isolation but the problem is that there are many just like it - ""I love Chocolate Doom but I wish it just had *X*"" where X can be any one of: higher resolutions, uncapped framerate, removed limits, better networking, etc. etc. Plenty of other source ports already exist which do those other things - Choco doesn't. That's just how it is and what the project's about. If we added these features it would lose the property that both you like and I like - its minimalism and the fact that it's just Doom, nothing else.
I hope that makes things a bit clearer to you. In your last comment you describe it as an ""arbitrary line"" and I really would dispute that - I can tell you that both personally and as a team we have put a lot of thought and discussion into the [PHILOSOPHY](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/blob/master/PHILOSOPHY.md) document. I think you'll find that if you look through past discussions, very few things in this project are ever arbitrary.
One thing in particular I'd point you is that PHILOSOPHY is very careful to define what ""vanilla"" means - Vanilla Doom is DOS Doom v1.9. So for example when you say:
> I'm now planning to just fork Chocolate and make a quick hack to allow optionally specifying the limit sizes. Still will be 100% vanilla compatible
the definition of ""vanilla"" becomes muddled, since vanilla has limits. Mappers are clear when they make levels for Doom to distinguish between ""vanilla"" and ""limit removing"", and it's not true that SIGIL or any other limit-removing levels are vanilla compatible. And that perhaps cuts to the heart of the whole point I'm trying to make - it's not just an arbitrary line, vanilla Doom is the yardstick we measure against, and it defines the scope of what the project's about."
2418,528942466,561381471,None,"I guess with ""arbitrary line"" he meant that we already offer to remove the Vanilla savegame and demo size limits. And indeed, I find myself unable to give any good reasoning why these two limits for all things are removed but any others aren't."
2419,528942466,561385086,None,"For demo size the rationale is pretty simple - vanilla Doom has the `-maxdemo` command line argument, so it's equivalent to just setting that to an arbitrarily large number such that you never meet it.
In the case of the savegame limit I'll admit it's slightly arbitrary, and it's a feature that dates to the first couple of years of the project, when the philosophy was much less codified. I'm skeptical whether we'd add it today, though I'm also loathe to remove it at this point."
2420,528942466,561396683,None,"A complicated braindump of some extra thoughts around this so that it perhaps doesn't seem quite so arbitrary:
* Savegame limit removal ""breaks the rules"" but that doesn't mean any other feature request that breaks the rules should therefore be allowed.
* Why I say I'm ""loathe to remove it"" is a complicated matter that basically comes down to pragmatism, because if it was removed, there are a bunch of prominent ""vanilla"" (note quotes) map sets which would now become unplayable in Choco unless you never save, and I would be loathe to lose them. In other words I'd probably end up running and maintaining a fork of my own port.
* On the same theme, the feedback I've heard from is that mappers haven't historically taken the savegame limit as seriously as the other limits, so there's a large number of levels which are ""vanilla except for the savegame limit"".
* Even some pre-source release levels (ie. made for vanilla Doom) from map sets like Hell Revealed and Requiem break the savegame limit.
* You can make the argument that the savegame limit is different in substance to the other mapping limits since it doesn't determine what you can play, only whether you can save or not.
* Vanilla Doom can actually load huge savegames just fine, it's just saving them that it can't do."
2421,528942466,561448303,None,"> You can make the argument that the savegame limit is different in substance to the other mapping limits since it doesn't determine what you can play, only whether you can save or not.
I actually think this point is key. I think breaking free of the savegame limit is a quality of life measure not far removed from demos, windowed mode, or PNG screenshots.
Both it and the demo limits walk the gray-area of the question the philosophy document asks: ""Although this is Vanilla behavior, is there anyone who would want this?"" — the answer to both of them can be yes and no, depending on context. Chocolate Doom defaults to restricting save games to the same limits as vanilla, and this may be important to any users that frequently switch between Vanilla and Choco."
2422,528942466,561474722,Bitter frustration,"@fragglet Thanks for taking the time to explain this further, I do really appreciate it. Though unfortunately I still don't feel any closer to really understanding the rationale to let one optional vanilla break exist but not another. Well, besides the *very* thin 'keeping Chocolate closer to Vanilla by not introducing more stuff'.
I don't believe I've made any contradictions, or at least not in the way you were explaining I did. Maybe I didn't write it out adequately enough before, so I'll try to re-iterate it against the points you made to hopefully help clarify my point. The feature I'm suggesting would have absolutely no affect at all on the vanilla experience, outside of getting to actually *have the experience*. I definitely wouldn't side with any of the counter changes you suggested to mine. Increased frame rate, increased resolution, changed networking... those type of changes would affect the vanilla experience and definitely would be 100% against the philosophy document. Chocolate should only have changes that can give greater access and range to the vanilla experience, which I feel experiencing these otherwise vanilla compliant maps is perfectly acceptable; but *only* as something optionally! It *shouldn't* be the default behavior to accommodate limit breaking maps and I would fully agree with that. But I feel there is no reason there can't be an option to allow for using these maps so people can get the 'vanilla experience' with them. That's sort of what I feel is the entire point of Chocolate - bringing the vanilla experience into the present.
I'm not quite sure why you feel the simpler approach I suggested for the limit raise would suddenly make the vanilla compatibility muddled for Chocolate. An array is still an array. An array created by a variable with the value of 127 would be exactly the same size as an array was created by a #define with the value of 127. So if the array sizes are defaulted to vanilla limits, I can't see how that muddles things in any way at all. Of course, if you explicitly tell it to muddle the limits, then obviously that would - akin to the demo and save limits. Though the more complicated approach of auto setting the limits I suggested, while still possible to do as arrays and get precisely the same vanilla behavior with defaults, would introduce a lot more non vanilla code; so I can understand that being a potential thumbs down at the very least.
But, it seems at this point though that we will likely just have to agree to disagree. It is only opinion vs. opinion now, and we appear to be unable to see eye to eye on the topic. Likely we will only waste each other's time trying to continue on. I'll just have to take some time over a weekend to make a tiny hack in a fork, and that'll be that. It is unfortunate though that the fork is even necessary for something so incredibly minor. But at least this way everyone else who also requested this feature can still use Chocolate Doom's exceptional vanilla experience and have the option play otherwise fully compatible maps as intended.
I'll just close with thanking you again for taking the time to try and explain this further. And thank you and everyone else who worked on and created Chocolate. It really is quite exceptional and amazing software, even despite this hold back it insists to carry. I have used Chocolate as my choice Doom port for years, and is why I was particularly interested to try and understand why something I feel would fit it perfectly as a non-disruptive option, apparently cannot."
2423,528942466,561487304,None,"I agree that a fork is the right approach here and I just want to say no hard feelings. There are many different forks of Chocolate Doom at this point and I always welcome people to create more (indeed, the codebase is designed to be fork-friendly). Please do stay in touch and feel free to add a page for it on the website if you like.
Edit: one tiny thing:
> I don't believe I've made any contradictions, or at least not in the way you were explaining I did. My point was this: Chocolate Doom's philosophy seeks to avoid unnecessary options, and it does this by rejecting most feature requests that seek to add them. I'd encourage reading [Havoc Pennington's essay](https://ometer.com/free-software-ui.html) on this subject which I've always loved, specifically the section titled ""the question of preferences""."
2424,528942466,561586902,None,"> That's sort of what I feel is the entire point of Chocolate - bringing the vanilla experience into the present.
It is not necessarily the *experience* (you can have that similarly with other ports like e.g. Eternity or PrBoom+). Choco's aim is to *replicate the behavior* of DOOM.EXE on modern systems. Of course, the former follows from the latter.
That's why I brought in the research project comparison. The question is ""what would happen in DOOM.EXE?"", not ""how would it feel in DOOM.EXE?"". I hope you see the difference."
2425,528942466,562193052,Insulting,"@fabiangreffrath Again, then why do you allow the vanilla breaking extended save file and demo formats still? Those *don't replicate the behavior of the DOOM.EXE whatsoever*. It's very hypocritical to try and justify not adding the *option* to increase the level limits for this reason, when you *already* provide options that *don't* replicate DOOM.EXE's behavior."
2426,528942466,562194510,Impatience,@fragglet literally just explained that.
2427,528942466,562196188,None,"... He explained why they are *there*, but that doesn't automatically resolve them of being hypocritical. Having those features present makes Chocolate defy its own principles and philosophy. You would need to remove them in order to *actually* be true to Vanilla.
Also if you didn't notice, fragglet also *agreed* that it was somewhat arbitrary they are there and likely acknowledged that they are indeed against the philosophy of Chocolate."
2428,528942466,562217764,Bitter frustration,"So again, the reason of ""staying true to DOOM.EXE"" has no legs to stand on when you *already* defy it. Only after removing the other philosophy offending features would it make any sense to argue that; which I would be wholeheartedly for and would also then agree that this feature request would be totally invalid.
Basically, either please actually be true to DOOM.EXE and remove all non vanilla breaking aspects or don't arbitrarily deny options that don't change the game play and presentation of the game since there are already some present that do *exactly* that. I don't know why this seems to be such an ""out there"" concept to have consistency."

#### Summary
Some changes in 2.10 make a BC break. On line 281 in OCI8Statement, the column is not valid in array, so throws a Notice: Undefined index: test.
Before upgrade to 2.10 the line looks like:
`$column = $this->_paramMap[$column] ?? $column;`
After upgrade do 2.10 is:
`$column = $this->_paramMap[$column];`
#### Current behaviour
Undefined index in array. The null coalesce operator was removed (WHY, who accept this ?)

Our Vagrant release cadence isn't too frequent, and there are lots of other issues and features that we're trying to get in for each release.
If you wish to get this moving faster, there is already a pull request on the plugin: https://github.com/smerrill/vagrant-gatling-rsync/pull/37 I recommend pinging the maintainer on there.
For fixing this today on your side, you should still be able to use the built in rsync synced folder feature, as this is the recommended way to use rsync and Vagrant. Alternatively, downgrading to Vagrant 2.2.5 and using that plugin until a fix has been met is also a possibility. You could also bring in the changes locally and run and install the plugin from source.
We can leave this open to track the issue for now in case others find it. If our next release time comes around and it's still not fixed on their side, I'll apply a patch that fixes this so that it works in 2.2.7. Thanks!"

I'm okay with getting blocked by you - but really, ""leaving"" the community because of INCORRECT Nim code not compiling (even if it compiles it'll crash at best since you didn't initialize the lock, and for printing you can just try to use repr or cast to a pointer and repr) is not okay. Also this is open source, not some software you paid for, so you maybe should've tried fixing it yourself before? :)"

2481,542105846,542105846,None,"Hi VS Code dev here :wave:
Open a python file, invoke a context menu in the editor and notice the following:
1) Run Current Test File command is there. When I execute it it says that I do not have testing enabled. I suggest to add this command only if testing is enabled in my workspace
2) Sort Imports -> shouldn't this be a part of the format document. I do not see why this command needs to be so promiment to take space in the context menu. Also there is already `Source Action...` command which shows the Sort Imports so this feels like duplication.
3) ""Run python file in terminal"" and ""Run selection line in python terminal"". I do not understand why one command says ""in terminal"" and the other ""in python terminal"". When I exectute them they just go to the terminal for me. Can we have some consistency in titles, or is it possible to drop one of those actions. Reason being, user can select the whole file and do Run selection, to cover the python file case
4) Run in Interactive window: I suggest to show this only if I have Jupter or whatever needed setup
5) Most of these actions do not make sense while you are debugging. I would also consider to hide them while the user is debugging (since the menu grows then additonally with vscode debug commands)

2489,544279140,544279140,None,"~Closes #752~ After some internal discussion, we're reverting this. See #1131.
To test this in your project, check out the branch and do two local installs from there:
* `pip install -e .` gets you `jinja`
* `pip install -e jinja2-compat` gets you a shim that redirects `jinja2` imports to `jinja` and emits a deprecation warning.
This seems to work in real code bases like Flask's tests and @indico. Once this is released, you'd only have to `pip install jinja2`, it depends on `jinja`. This should allow projects to gradually rename their imports and continue to use packages that still depend on `jinja2` and aren't updated."
2490,544279140,569998183,None,"However, some weird issues come up when you undo the changes to the tests so they all still import from `jinja2`.
First is that the tests won't run because there's a circular import issue with `from jinja2 import asyncfilters` getting imported before `asyncsupport`. This apparently already fails in master, but for some reason test collection only triggers it when going through the redirect.
If you exclude/remove the async tests, tests that expect exceptions begin failing with seemingly the correct exception. Apparently, something about the import internals causes `from jinja2.exceptions import TemplateNotFound` and `from jinja.exceptions import TemplateNotFound` to have the same repr but different ids."
2491,544279140,569998612,None,"I've tried experimenting with some other methods as well:
* Adding a special finder to `sys.meta_path` seems to have the same issues as above.
* Creating placeholder modules that do `from jinja.{name} import *` doesn't include anything that starts with `_`, which while not public could cause compatibility issues.
* Generating placeholders that literally import `*` and every `_name` works but ties compatibility to the imported private names remaining available into the future."
2492,544279140,570095954,None,"Switched to a new solution that doesn't have the problems I was seeing when messing with `sys.modules`. Now `jinja2` just has modules matching what's in `jinja`, with a special function that re-exports all the public and `_` names and emits a warning. Names starting with `__` (double underscore) are skipped as that seemed to be causing the issues.
The shim should continue working as long as the modules in `jinja` continue to match, and a quick release could be made to add more modules if we still want to maintain compatibility later.
All tests pass with `jinja` or `jinja2` imports."
2493,544279140,570431370,None,"Tentatively planning to have the jinja2 package depend on ""jinja<4.0"" so that developers have the entire 3.0 cycle (however long that is, there's no plans for 4.0 yet) to upgrade. Past that, I may update the package to extend the support, but not making any promises.
As mentioned above, the only way the shim becomes incompatible is if module names change, which is unlikely, but it has happened with, for example, Werkzeug to improve organization. So supporting the 3.0 cycle means not permanently moving anything if it happens at all until 4.0, which is sort of what a major version bump is for anyway."

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --pre Jinja2
```
You should get Jinja 2.11.0rc1 pulled in as a dependency and both `jinja` and `jinja2` should be importable."

**Describe the bug**
I can't access some data via GraphQL versus simple fetch.

1- Create a new _avatar_ media field on users. 2- Try to get that avatar via the below GraphQL query:
````graphql
query {
me {
username
avatar {url}
}
}
````
3)- You'll get the below error:
_""Cannot query field \""avatar\"" on type \""UsersPermissionsMe\"".""_ with a _GRAPHQL_VALIDATION_FAILED_ code.

If you can find a way to force the buffer name to resolve on win32, we can do that as well. I would start with `exe 'cd' fnameescape(getcwd())`.
Throwing `resolve()` elsewhere is a game of whack-a-mole, plus it adds IO to things that are supposed to be fast. It's not a tenable solution."

I did some testing and I think that the problem lies in Git for Windows, that works differently, in that it doesn't realizes that the two files belong to the same repository. The command gives _the same error_ also if run from the terminal (cmd.exe).
I updated git, just in case, but the error persists. I think only a `resolve()` call in the `:Gwrite` command for `win32` can fix this.
These are the `cmd` generated in https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/blob/c83355d5c52002f94d08267f1d14ca6d1a2763e9/autoload/fugitive.vim#L429

WLS Debian (neovim), also here $HOME/.vim/plugin is a symlink to the Dropbox directory,
:Gwrite works and the file path is changed to its resolved path

'--literal-pathspecs', 'add', '--',
'/home/gianmaria/.vim/plugin/buffer_history.vim']

gVim Windows, also here the starting paths are different, but the command doesn't work
['-C', 'D:/Gianmaria/Dropbox (Personale)/Linux/vimrc/plugin',
'--literal-pathspecs', 'add', '--',

In WSL terminal, this works
$ git -C /mnt/d/Gianmaria/Dropbox\ \(Personale\)/Linux/vimrc/plugin --literal-pathspecs add -- /home/gianmaria/.vim/plugin/buffer_history.vim
In cmd.exe, this doesn't work (same error as with fugitive):

All of Fugitive is built around the assumption that the buffer name is the the real path. At first I ignored this, but then bugs cropped up when people called `:cd` and the buffer name changed from a symlink path to a real path mid flight, so my solution was to force a `:cd .` early, thus preventing symlink paths from ever entering the equation. What you've told me is that this `:cd .` doesn't work. Two solutions spring to mind:
1. Find a way to make it work (where ""make it work"" is ""resolve symlink in the buffer name"").
2. If there is no way to make it work, then the original bug is irrelevant. Stop calling `resolve()` on the Git dir and work tree and everything should be back to matched up.
The following solutions do not spring to mind:
1. Change the semantics of one public function by adding `resolve()` to it, and verify that the one command that is confirmed broken is fixed.
Please stop doubling down on the bad idea that I told you is bad, and try the thing I asked you to try:
> I would start with exe 'cd' fnameescape(getcwd()).

Ironically, after I started writing this you edited in a decent idea.
> I made a mapping to resolve current file, and it works with it:

> ```
See also https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/pull/814#issuecomment-446767081 where I attempt to provide a more robust way to do this automatically. This is the sort of thing I would consider doing, but getting to work right requires calling `edit` to reload the file, and I worry that editing the file from `BufReadPost` will cause non-obvious bugs. I would encourage you to try it, at least until the issue is fixed."
2546,549848681,574985485,None,"I think I'll use that `Resolve` command of your post and chain it with my `Gwrite` mapping
```
nnoremap \gw :Resolve<cr>:Gwrite<cr>

About the issue not being with Git for Windows, I doubt it, because in Linux git commands autoresolve links, in Windows they do not. Because this works in Linux
```
$ git -C /mnt/d/Gianmaria/Dropbox\ \(Personale\)/Linux/vimrc/plugin --literal-pathspecs add -- /home/gianmaria/.vim/plugin/buffer_history.vim

--file=- to pipe to stdin/stdout.
--global Read the Brewfile from ~/.Brewfile.
brew bundle [install] [-v|--verbose] [--no-upgrade]
[--file=path|--global]
Install or upgrade all dependencies in a Brewfile.
-v, --verbose Print the output from commands as they are
run.
--no-upgrade Don't run brew upgrade on outdated
dependencies. Note they may still be
upgraded by brew install if needed.
brew bundle dump [--force] [--describe] [--no-restart]
[--file=path|--global]
Write all installed casks/formulae/taps into a Brewfile.
--force Overwrite an existing Brewfile.
--describe Include a description comment above each
line, unless the dependency does not have a
description.
--no-restart Do not add restart_service to formula
lines.
brew bundle cleanup [--force] [--zap] [--file=path|--global]
Uninstall all dependencies not listed in a Brewfile.
--force Actually perform the cleanup operations.
--zap Remove casks using the zap command
instead of uninstall.
brew bundle check [--verbose] [--no-upgrade] [--file=path|--global]
Check if all dependencies are installed in a Brewfile.
-v, --verbose Print and check for all missing
dependencies.
--no-upgrade Ignore outdated dependencies.
brew bundle exec command
Run an external command in an isolated build environment.
brew bundle list [--all|--brews|--casks|--taps|--mas]

dependencies are listed.
--all List all dependencies.
--brews List Homebrew dependencies.
--casks List Homebrew Cask dependencies.
--taps List tap dependencies.
--mas List Mac App Store dependencies.

As discussed in #4182, I'd like to request the addition of the ""override_ext"" front matter tag.
## Motivation
I'm using php code on my website, like many others, too. I can create a ""test.php"" file, and the generated file will have the "".php""-extension, all right. However, I want to use markdown for my blog posts, and these "".md"" files are automatically generated to "".html"" files! And because the posts have a .""php"" layout with php code, but the file ends up as html, the site does not work. OK, I could create a permalink as suggested in the issue linked above, but that's a bad workaround because I don't want to hardcode the file name and directory.
A similar request has been discussed already, but I find the [excuses](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/5646#issuecomment-357329996) quite weak. As of now, it's hardcoded for markdown files to be converted to html files, and that's simply not right. Give us an option here!
Edit: OK, it's not really needed for other files where I can already set my custom extension manually, this would just add more confusion. But for all files which jekyll automatically converts into a hardcoded format, this should be changeable - most likely in config.yml."

An arbitrary extension or no-extension file will be parsed with liquid if it has frontmatter and then jekyll outputs as .html
And if you set the permalink in the file you can force the extension to be .json, .php , etc.

2590,574196668,600409859,Bitter frustration,"> The tests are still not passing
I will repeat for the last time : THE TEST REQUIRES THE BUG TO BE PRESENT.
The bug manifests itself by outputting ``Label 0`` for -1 < indexes < 0 instead of outputting an empty string ``""""``. The test is passed when the bug is present, that is when``Label 0`` is wrongly outputted. The test fails when the bug is NOT present, that is when ``IndexFormatter`` returns an empty string, ``""""``, AS IT SHOULD.
The solution --- which consists only of rounding the index value, ``round(i)`` instead of truncating the index value, ``int(i + 0.5)`` --- returns an empty string, ``""""``. The solution fails the test because the test is WRONG. The test is by itself A BUG.
> From my point of view we have been waiting on you.
I CANNOT CORRECT THE TEST. IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AND PREROGATIVE.
> the need to document the API changes
If you adopt the solution, THERE NO NEED TO CHANGE THE DOCUMENTATION NOR THE API
> why IndexFormatter should not be deprecated)
Because, WITH THE SOLUTION instead a deprecation :
1. IndexFormatter works. It simply works, as intended, without any bug.
2. ``IndexFormatter(x_labels)`` is far simpler than proposed convoluted alternatives like ``FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: dict(zip(range(len(x_labels)), x_labels)).get(x, """"))`` to achieve the same exact end result.
3. The solution doesn't break back compatibility in the middle of minor revision. The users don't have to change their programs. They don't have to find an alternative. 4. It follows the precepts of semantic versioning instead of adopting post hoc rationalisations (like ""others deprecated functionalities in the middle of minor revision so lets pretend it's okay for us to do the same"")
5. You don't have to spend time and energy changing the documentation. You don't have to teach the users alternative methods that are necessarily harder to implement and explain.
6. Apparently, the DEPRECATION is based, at least partially, on the false assumption that a decade of zero complaints from the users somehow means the users are unhappy with IndexFormatter and therefore don't use it. 7. THE DEPRECATION misses entirely the point of avoiding the vicious cycle of complexity. Increasing complexity to achieving the same exact functionality is a huge waste of your time. It only make you busier and busier, writing more convoluted code and spending more time managing harder to debug bugs.
I have wasted enough of my time trying to convince you. So be it."
2591,574196668,600427099,Impatience,"@Wlodarski Saying that it is the responsibility of the person proposing a change to make the tests pass does _not_ mean that the new behavior cannot be adopted. You can fix the test to match desired behavior, and that is still the perogative of the implementor.
That said, changing the test is a _strong_ indicator that the API _has_ changed. You may see it as minor, you may see it as correcting to expected behavior. Nonetheless it is changed, which should be documented in accordance with the projects goals.
I am not speaking as representative of Matplotlib, only as a member of the broader open source community.
You seem to be focussing on your particular use case, and I don't blame you. You found something you thought unexpected, and found a rather simple fix for it. I applaud you for being willing to dive into a complicated codebase and find that solution.
That said, please acknowledge that the maintainers are acting in good faith here, that they are considering what you have pointed to, but are also looking out for the best interests of the userbase as a whole. You may disagree with them, and that's fair. But being silent for two weeks, then getting angry when they point to unresolved discussion points is not a productive disagreement.
The matplotlib project, being so core to how so many other people do their work, has very stringent expectations when it comes to behavioral changes, even small ones, by design, while balancing the desire to move forward, add features, clean up code, etc. And for future reference, two weeks is an extremely short time in open source software. Most of the people here are volunteers, working on their own free time. I myself have had PRs open for months (including one active one in this project) that have ultimately lead to being merged.

Specifically in regards to what falls under repo ownership.
It would come to reason to me that landing pull requests would be a ""day-to-day"" task for said project captains, and their particular merging strategies, commit message formats, etc. would serve the repo on a technical front, as outlined in this document.
I think part of the goal of project captains is to empower them to manage their repos, and commit messages seems to fall directly in that category to me. For example, if a project captain wants to use something like standard-release to automate releases and history file generation, they may need specific structure to commit messages. We should strive to empower the owners to do what they think will improve their workflow.
But maybe I'm misunderstanding on that point. Especially if I'm misunderstanding, that definately means we need greater clarity in the document, as we don't want to have everyone interpreting it differently, I presume.

2615,586054883,586054883,None,"Hi, Memcached team,
Recently, I revealed a buffer overflow vulnerability which may cause DOS attack. The exploit details can be found as following.
### Affect Version
memcached-1.6.0
memcached-1.6.1
### Root cause
file location: memcached.c:6156-6187
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29170518/77297732-b15af580-6d24-11ea-8d4d-ca9befffeae5.png)
### Code Audit
```c
6178 char extbuf[sizeof(c->binary_header) + BIN_MAX_EXTLEN];
6179 memcpy(extbuf + sizeof(c->binary_header), c->rcurr + sizeof(c->binary_header), **extlen**);
```
in line 6179, since there is no mechanism to verify the parameter's length, in this case, the length of ""**extlen**"" when calling memcpy function, It will cause buffer overflow if large value assigned to the **extlen** variable.
### POC
```
0x80 0x01 [0x00 0x00] keylen
[0x30] extlen 0x00 0x00 x00
```
for the POC snippet, first, if I assign a large value to the variable **extlen**, on the other hand, in order to bypass the validation of data packet which sent in following code snippet,
`6156 if (c->rbytes < keylen + extlen + sizeof(c->binary_header))`
we can construct a very large data packet and send it to the server running **memcached** 1.6.0 or 1.6.1 anonymously. After that, the program will crash because of the issue mentioned above.
Note: Please confirm this issue ASAP. Besides, just letting you know, I am gonna submit this issue to CVE mitre.
Please let me if you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Icejl"

> The term ""JavaScript"" is used to refer to ECMA-262, rather than the official term ECMAScript, since the term JavaScript is more widely known. Similarly, the MIME type used to refer to JavaScript in this specification is `text/javascript`, since that is the most commonly used type, despite it being an officially obsoleted type according to RFC 4329. [RFC4329]
[And](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#scriptingLanguages):
> Servers should use `text/javascript` for JavaScript resources. Servers should not use other JavaScript MIME types for JavaScript resources, and must not use non-JavaScript MIME types.
RFC 4329 does not match reality. The HTML Standard does (in this particular case), and https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dispatch-javascript-mjs/ is in the final stages of being standardized so that RFC 4329 is officially deprecated at the IETF/IANA level.
There's a bit of a chicken-egg problem in that server software often has a policy of only considering IETF/IANA even when those standards are clearly out of touch with reality, like in this case. This leads to ridiculous situations like Python's built-in `SimpleHTTPServer` adding support for `.mjs` with the wrong `application/javascript` MIME type. 🤷‍♂️
I hope you consider changing changing `mime-db`'s without waiting for https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dispatch-javascript-mjs/ to be finalized."

----
This database drives libraries that many widely used static file servers use to determine and serve mime types for JS files. Every minute, 10s or 100s of thousands of these files are being served up to clients, most with ""incorrect"" headers.
In my case, the incorrect headers were causing problems with my PWA not being properly/fully validated by tools in the chrome ecosystem like Lighthouse. So I had to fork the static file server and add logic to override the mime-type. I've had to maintain that fork for 3+ years now. Quite frankly, that's a huge security risk even if it wasn't also a giant pain.
Point being: there are real costs to being slow to adopt/reflect the reality of this change.
If the change was still in debate/discussion, I would definitely understand the hesitation. But the period for that has now passed. I think it's time to act."
2661,613337048,613337048,None,"## Summary
In some scenarios it can be easier/safer to pass JWT tokens to clients through cookies (secure, sameSite, httpOnly, etc) so that they don't store those in localStorage/have to add those themselves to requests to the back-end.
Having CouchDB be able of extracting a JWT from a Cookie in addition/as an alternative to the Authorization header would be beneficial for such scenarios.
## Desired Behaviour
Being able to configure CouchDB to extract JWT tokens from cookies (in addition or as an alternative to the Authorization header).
## Additional context
My project uses a fairly classical high level architecture:
* Back-end system exposing a RESTful API
* Front-end single-page application
The back-end RESTful API issues self-signed JWT tokens and provides those to the SPA through secure/samesite/httpOnly cookies so as to simplify management and keep a good level of security. This works fine in our scenario since there's a single origin. When the SPA issues requests against the RESTful API, the cookie containing the JWT token is attached transparently by the user agent.
If that same JWT token could also be trusted by CouchDB (which is now possible with 3.1.0 as far as I understand) and if CouchDB could extract it from the cookie, then our SPA clients could seamlessly authenticate against CouchDB.
For the longer term, OAuth support would indeed be nice, but I can imagine that it is already somewhere on CouchDB's roadmap."
2662,613337048,1616316141,None,"**I second this motion.** Parsing HTTP Cookies is trivial. CouchDB would simply need to specify the key, or the name, of the cookie that contains the JWT.
**I recommend cookie shall have a configurable key value which can be set under the `[chttpd]` section. This delivers maximum flexibility.**
It is said to be best practice to issue JWT's as HTTPOnly cookies meaning that they are not available to client/browser JavaScript. In other words, _HTTPOnly_ cookies make it impossible to build a custom header aligning with CouchDB's interface, namely `Authorization: Bearer <JWT token>`

VS Code is not the answer for everything. It's a text editor not even a proper IDE. I'm not building hobby projects. Enterprise projects need a proper IDE.
It's not a bad thing when everything provided by mom. it increase productivity and I can force my brain cells to work on a problem. You should build an OS based on your mom argument because it provide you **great** reward while others getting frustrated.

Out of box, retroarch is extremely complex even for advanced users. Who thought that F1 is great idea for menu? Why not escape like in usual games/emulators?
The only advantage of ra vs standalone emulators is that it support shader and TECHNICALLY it could be better, but on practice its 100mb of shader folder. Whats wrong with syncronization, why snes has sound crackling out of box? U link syncronization with monitors sync rate but it seems like it changes. Why you cant do like previous old emulators did and somehow link emulation with stable generator? Its not very bad if u sync game with time, not display
Why sound should lag in 2020?
Why you linked sound control with DB and pression +- returns random volume?
For example, just scaled image with bilinear filter looks extremely clean like this

U provide users extremely complex shader pack with AAAAAAA effects for tik tok
Why, if games created for playing, not playing in emulators? I promise that you software makes people VERY angry

Why does its so necessary to load ffmeg library and crash if u remove this? It needs a lot of memory and huge size of emulator part. Are u really sure that so much users want to record the game or stream on twich?

While most of the competitive RA community are good people, there is a rotten core of toxic entitlement that manifests as abuse and belittlement, often focused around ERCC, and usually focused personally against me. This behaviour has forever soured ERCC, and integrating it into the upstream RA mod now would validate that behaviour as an effective strategy for influencing OpenRA's development.
Why now? Two recent incidents targeting me (from N/A in the community discord, and Longely/Widow in the competitive discord - the two main personalities behind ERCC) were incredibly offensive and belittling, and are the straw that has broken the camels back when added on top of many other generally toxic events this year. People in the competitive community were having fun meming about ""us vs the devs"" earlier this year, but at that time I was seriously considering quitting OpenRA completely due to how unhappy and embarrased the behaviour of some people in the community (and the general tolerance of that behaviour as acceptable by everybody else) was making me. Ultimately, I decided that I enjoy working on the project, and making things better for everybody else in the community. I *do not* enjoy interacting with the assholes, and intend to be increasingly blunt in dismissing their toxic behaviour. This is the first concrete action towards that.
I can certainly appreciate the desire for solving directional map imbalance, to the point where I fully implemented the code for one solution (rotatable structures) and developed a working prototype for a second (allowing harvesters to dock from any direction, visually jumping docking point). I think there is scope for some ERCC alternative, but I suggest that the competitive community as a whole put some effort into solving its attitude problem before they try to revisit such ideas here."

### Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->
The horrible effects of human slavery continue to impact society. The
casual use of the term ""slave"" in computer software is an unnecessary
reference to a painful human experience.
### Description
<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->
This commit removes all possible references to the term ""slave"".
Implementation notes:
The zpool.d/slaves script is renamed to dm-deps, which uses the same
terminology as `dmsetup deps`.
References to the `/sys/class/block/$dev/slaves` directory remain. This
directory name is determined by the Linux kernel. Although
`dmsetup deps` provides the same information, it unfortunately requires
elevated privileges, whereas the `/sys/...` directory is world-readable.

We should always be examining our process and thinking about what we can do to improve and make small iterative changes towards where we want to be.
The term `master` for the main tracking branch is something that has always bothered me. To push back against any narrative that might claim that changing the name of the branch is a fad I'd like to point to https://github.com/mylesborins/node-osc which is one of my more popular modules. I have been using the name `current` rather than `master` for over a year. The only reason why I had not brought up making this change at the project was because I didn't think it would have the momentum to be successful, not because I didn't believe that this change should be made.
@mscdex do you have specific technical failures you are concerned will happen? Would an in depth transfer that speaks to all of those changes put your mind at ease? If there was a way to ensure that anyone attempting to push or work with `master` in the future would be gracefully redirected by GitHub help to ease those concerns (this is a feature I'm poking at internally to see if it can be offered). > I believe attaching a single context to such technical terminology (that involves inanimate things) is not useful. Instead, everyone should be focusing their time and effort on things in the world that are actually and obviously offensive.
We debated extensively about naming API surfaces, why should this be any different? We accepted a default and those helping to create that default are saying ""hmm, maybe we should reconsider this"". Even if you don't find it useful to attach that context does that fact that others do, and in turn it makes them less productive at what they do, not resonate with you?

@gireeshpunathil I'm having a really hard time parsing the logic here. It seems like you are saying that because making this change will be easier than other changes will imply there is no other work to be done? I don't think anyone is saying that at all. What I do see people saying is that this is a small incremental change, that will take quite a bit of work to do properly... but one that I think will be meaningful to various members of our community.
FWIW I've been thinking quite a bit about our governance model, and more specifically consensus seeking, to examine if it is the best governance model for an inclusive environment. I proposed a [openjs world summit session](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/summit/issues/297) to discuss it as well!
I truly think that making positive social change is an ongoing effort that requires constant small change in the right direction. In fact I would argue that choosing to not make smaller, more obvious, iterative changes (such as changing our default branch) would have the inverse effect of telling people that Node.js is an environment that does not care about this."

Maybe it would work if we push an empty master branch and protect it? I don't know what would happen with GitHub automatic redirects in this case...
IIUC the concern is only until the migration happens (i.e. until when both `master` and `main` exist and are in sync in nodejs/node), correct? We can plan a time for the migration (similarly to what we do with security releases and CI upgrades), communicate it, and then during that time we restrict push to this repo to those involved in the migration. Once the migration is completed, we restore push to `@nodejs/collaborators`, and ensure the branch protections for `master` only let the bot push to it. I _think_ we can even add a git hook for push to give collaborators a message telling them to use `main` instead of `master` when pushing (not entirely sure).
Another idea I have (which I've been thinking for a different repository/organization, is to use the `post-checkout` git hook to communicate every time someone checks out to master (and try to identify if it was ran on our CI etc). That would help us identify when usage of master branch drops enough for us to safely discontinue it."
2847,638202113,933730999,None,"If both `master` and `main` exist, though, then github won't redirect people from the former to the latter - it'd be better to keep `master` entirely deleted (altho i think branch protections could still prevent it being pushed to)"

any specific ideas on what needs to be done here? Happy to help of course.
I think the big thing is that we'll all want to be ready to help out when _something_ inevitably breaks because `master` is hardcoded. Looking through a [very unsophisticated GitHub Search](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=master), we do have a lot of `master` in the codebase and some of them definitely seem to be referring to branches, including in python and Markdown. I think Markdown should be an easy fix in the future, but it's something that will need to be done."

This was a long an incremental effort (almost 2 years) and I'd like to thank @richardlau and @sxa who helped me do some of the tricker/more complicated repos. It was easier to do those as a group than it would have been for any one person on their own. Also thank to all of the other collaborators who supported in ways from finding a way to prevent accidental pushes of the old branch to quickly responding to issues suggesting the rename in repos across the nodejs org.
I'd also like to thank Red Hat management who early in the larger discussion on renaming primary repos across the GitHub ecosystem not only supported but asked teams to help open source communities make the change."
2885,638202113,1173688210,None,Added fix to [node-stress-single-stress](https://ci.nodejs.org/view/Stress/job/node-stress-single-test/) today which had a reference to the old name hiding in an advanced panel in the jenkins UI :-)

Whole world use master/slave terminology in almost all technical sciences and there is no reason to change it. As I am not communist, I am doing regular commit and PR and not rewriting the (git) history by force ...
### Motivation and Context
Removes political agitation from the code. Makes code much more readable and clean. ### Description
Only clean revert of previous weird commit. No additional changes.
### How Has This Been Tested?
Didn't make any tests.
### Types of changes
<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->
- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [ ] Performance enhancement (non-breaking change which improves efficiency)
- [x] Code cleanup (non-breaking change which makes code smaller or more readable)
- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)
- [ x] Documentation (a change to man pages or other documentation)"
2888,638643486,644269964,None,"I disagree that reverting to the previous language makes the code more readable and clear. In fact, it does the opposite. The patch adopts the ""dependency"" terminology used by `dmsetup(8)` in order to be as precise as possible when describing the functionality."
2889,638768339,638768339,None,"Words such as ""wh\*telist"" or ""b\*acklist"" are racist. We cannot have those absolutely disgusting derogatory words in our codebase. Therefore, we need to change them to race-neutral words.
There are more references to racial supremacy throughout the code. These should be discussed.
Should this macro be renamed to `skip_blankspace`?
https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/blob/master/module/nvpair/nvpair.c#L46
Also, in the Lua module, we mark objects as ""wh\*te"" or ""b\*ack"". I suggest changing the colors to some non-offensive ones. I propose indigo (`#4B0082`) and forest green (`#228B22`).
https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/blob/master/module/lua/lgc.c
### Motivation and Context
Following other open-source projects, we should strive to keep the ZFS code base clean of any vulgar, racist or other unnecessary remarks and to allow for friendly and welcoming environment for people of all kinds.
### How Has This Been Tested?
It compiles - it's just basic refactoring.

2900,639133998,639133998,None,"There is currently a strong debate about whether the standard branch should be given a name that has less negative implications than ""master"". The starting point was apparently this [thread on the Git Mailing List](https://lore.kernel.org/git/CAOAHyQwyXC1Z3v7BZAC+Bq6JBaM7FvBenA-1fcqeDV==apdWDg@mail.gmail.com/), which, as far as I know, brought the topic up for the first time. It is criticized that the term ""master"" might have a negative connotation for people who were directly or indirectly affected by slavery. I think that especially in the light of the fact that the Rust Community is known for its openness towards all ethics and minorities, serious consideration should be given to renaming the master branch correspondingly. The GitHub CEO himself has already expressed his support for the idea (see [this tweet](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1271253144442253312?s=19)), and the official GitHub cli repository has also already been changed accordingly.
Currently, it seems that the following two are the most common alternatives to the term ""master"":
- trunk
- main
GitHub has chosen the term trunk for the cli repository. Whether the name of the master branch of this repository should be changed accordingly should be discussed. I'm open to any constructive opinions on this topic."

And... Out of box your software is totally unusable, especially for kids
These AI, wtf is this? Why even cheap old chinese consoles with shitty hardware can just launch games and play without fucking with settings, but your software can not?
You have tons of shaders, but no shader preview. With paint.net u can preview changes, in your AAA software u cant. Very slow navigation, it does not remember position
Extremely huge interface
My config is this

Why you describe wtf does 'audio' means? Can u make it fit in screen
Ozone has no scrollbar, no mouse support, if u try to scroll, actually its equal to up/down button
People dont wait that software does not work with mouse
U cant explain even default configuration, what button u need to press for some effect

U can draw something like normal games if gamepad is not connected like 'L - ok', 'O - cancel'
How to reset settings with start button u dont descibe too
Why do u draw licence? It takes much space

Why not organize cores like
NES\
Snes\
U just give people huge list of all cores. What difference between then - there is no description. But u can see that lisense is GPL v3, very important information haha
Your software with 'release' has >13000 of files, size is bigger than 600mb and out of box it even does not have any core
Alphabet keys are assigned on emulator functions. If u wanna make keyboard gamepad like
wasd iokl it will conflikt, and no highlight. WTF, why F1 calls menu? Do u know that many people use laptop, they can assign something on F keys by default
And they have to press Fn+F1 to call menu, who wait that?
Your bloatwared AAAAAA software is extremely glitchy, unusable for NORMAL people
Even your buttons numeration

On 1st place u put very strange settings like bind timeout, duty cycle

Its just my thoughts
People says that u need to be correct, but actually retroarch is not correct of anything. It has some logic, ok, but this logic works only for developers and geeks
Who wait from gaming software that F1 calls menu? Or there is mouse, but actually mouse does not work like normal mouse. Does making scrollbars or mouse support is more difficult that AI discord twitch?
Why am I see that video button changes 'video output settings'
Does user so stupid that he does not know what video means? But this stupid user must know that F1 calls menu
Base mission of emulators is providing people play in games. Just install and play, whats wrong with this logic? May be it needs some delays, but retroarch as i know is crazy about strange ultra super zero latency. Sound could lag on not super PC, but its okay, coz there is super zero latency is activated
For most cases laptop is enough. ps1 emulators worked on pentium 3
psp with 333mhz cpu and 32mb ram has emulators of snes gba, whatever, fullspeed no lags even with some delays buffer size whatever

I found that @hizzlekizzle was very cool and polite to accept it. Retroarch is an incredible piece of software, powerful but complex to master. To be constructive, I would suggest that maybe all @noiseshaade frustration, and probably many others could be solved with an option to launch a ""first time launch wizard"" that allows less savvy users to get retroarch up and running with a few clicks here and there: Just basically downloading a few cores depending on the system you want to emulate, setting up the gamepad, enable kiosk mode, and you are good to go. With that you cover the bare basics to have it up and running and you can later prettify or tweak the output to your liking. I also found nice the shader preview suggestion (and also a notification of ""resource intensive shader"" would be good). I had some struggles finding out , by example, which was the highest level of XBRz shader my HTPC could handle without getting sluggish. Sometimes it got so slow that I had to kill retroarch because it was faster to relaunch it than waiting to reach the shader menu again.
Not everyone will agree with me, that's just my two cents."
2919,643360992,647810394,None,"Its poweful... But powerful for who?
What 'zero latency' means?
For example, u can reduce audio buffer size from 64ms to 1ms. Latency is 64x time less, but actually normally u will not see any difference. And it needs as i know extremely powerful hardware
On normal hardware it will be extremely laggy as i know
Its possible to make these 'ultra small latencies' so small that comfortable SNES emulation needs intel i9 10900k 6GHz DDR6 128Gb ram quantum pc neural AAA networks whatever, but its not fun"

Modern games are AAA shit, overloaded with special effects, its not magic, its not fun, they just eat resources. People or kids do no wanna play in 'modern' games
its nothing wrong if by default retroarch does not eat many resources, if somebody needs these zero latency or what these guys use, he can activate it
retroarch focused on mobile phones, but actually playing in old games from touchscreen is awful
there is some cool things for phones which turn them to psp like console

@noiseshaade we don't have anything invested in the teespring merchandise. It's just a free service that sells stuff with your logo/designs for a cut of the proceeds. In contrast, it's very expensive and labor-intensive to produce, market and sell your own electronics hardware. It's something we've wanted to do for a very long time, but it has very high up-front costs (upwards of $20k for the controllers we were looking at a few years ago) and we would have to store the stock, mail out orders (internationally), deal with refunds, etc."

Hmm. I do not need 'pleasant ui'
Project exist 10 years. Classic emulator like nestopia snes9x was created with very small team, or with only one person

Return to normal emulator
I just know that i can calibrate picture using shaders, for me advantages of ra vs epsxe-like emulators is only framerate counter - it means i can generate dynamic noise. And there is gaussian blur preset, im not shader coder
Then it can be used on nes or any console

For players its like 'before scaling' and 'after scaling', it possible to use fullscreen as surface. It allows u hide (apply levels correction) black borders and apply noise for them too
Ra has strange behaviour. For example if u wanna work with screen as surface, u have to use bilinear filter. Imho if u use just blur instead of bilinear filter, it gives better results

The third silly thing is that you're acting like IPython doesn't have any changes that break some pieces of code or tutorials out there. All in all it makes your comment seem more like irrational stubbornness than actual concerns.
Not to mention, if it's _that_ hard to change the folder, then that hardcoding seems like a massive code smell anyways and should be fixed anyways, and the choice to set the location of the folder should be up to the user."

And so yes the official documentation is one of the last place users looks for that information, and yes sometime they look at the latest docs for 5 years old IPython version.
Yes `~/.ipython` is not optimal, and no it's not a code smell we removed all the complex logic because it was brittle and was super confusing, and because every time we were teaching software carpentry there was section with all the combinaisons of linux/mac/windows IPython version x.y.z
So yes I was of your opinion 10 years ago, and no to this days I still don't know the 3 path on each of the platform, even on Mac which I'm using everyday and which now hides ~/Library in the finder.
You can change the code location by setting environment variables, and I told you that if it was not working with configuration in xdg dir I would gladly accept patches for that so that you have the choice. Now if it's to criticize the code without proper understanding of the technical and social reason of why it is the way it is, and bring XDG zealotry into the mix, I'm even less likely to make an effort.

2975,704818674,695195037,None,"@storeilly, @kraney, @maallyn I updated the code on the feature_singlemixserver branch with the following functionality:
- The master ""director"" client defines the mode, i.e. if mono/stereo and the audio quality.
- The slave clients have to use the same mono/stereo and audio quality settings as the director, otherwise their client will show ""TRYING TO CONNECT"" all the time until it automatically disconnects after a while.
- Only the master ""director"" sees the full audio mixer board faders and can control the audio mix. All slave clients will see an empty audio mixer board.
It would be great to get feedback from you:
- Is the source code stable?
- Does it work according to the above specification?
- How many clients does a fast server PC can serve in that mode (I would recommend to use Mono mode to get the most number of clients)?"

What I see as a problem is that the clients just see ""TRYING TO CONNECT"". I'd prefer (at least for newer clients) to show ""Please set the audio quality/... as follows: [...]"" or even a server message which sets them automatically. If you don't do that it would probably rise quite some support questions and problems."

removing an element of control from them. If they can't adjust their own
perception of their volume in the mix without affecting how others hear it,
they will compensate and use the control that they have which does. They
will sing too loud or too quiet (depending on personality type). Any
attempt by an outside force (the director) to balance the mix will force
them to increase the compensation to detrimental levels.

The levels would be set by the director, apart from a participant's own level, which they could set for themselves. Perhaps it would still need a ""balance"" so you could raise your own level against the rest of the mix, or in this mode, your own slider becomes ""balance"" -- at the bottom, you only hear everyone else, at the top, you only hear yourself, in the middle you hear the director's mix.

I have a little concern with the “first to connect” solution for selecting a director only because, supposing it goes wrong and someone accidentally joins before the director, how can it be resolved? Everyone has to leave and then wait for confirmation by the director via some other channel before rejoining? However I understand the desire to minimize the disruption to the code.
One other idea for selection comes to mind - maybe the director is the first one to join who chooses a baton as his instrument?"

They will sing too loud or too quiet (depending on personality type). Any attempt by an outside force (the director) to balance the mix will force them to increase the compensation to detrimental levels.
That may or may not be. I think this strongly depends on how the singers can adapt to the mix. For some it may be simple to adapt, for some it may not be possible to sing. But this can only be evaluated on a real test with a lot of singers, I guess.
> I'd prefer (at least for newer clients) to show ""Please set the audio quality/... as follows: [...]"" or even a server message which sets them automatically.
Sure, a lot things could be done. The current code implements the basic functionality. If it turns out that this mode is useless, all additional effort would be wasted. So the first step is to verify that this mode works with a lot of singers (which are all instructed before entering the server what they have to set in the Jamulus client). If that was successful, more time could be spent to improve that server mode.
> Is there any way what's done could be tuned to having each participant (apart from the director) see only their own channel control? This wouldn't save server side processing - you'd still have n mixes to create.
Yes, exactly. If you want any individual mix, you have to use the normal mode.
> I'd also think a ""list participants"" option would be needed. Otherwise I'd be wondering ""who's here?"" all the time.
The server could send a Chat message when a new client enters the server. But as I wrote above, before any more time is spent, it has to be verified that this new mode works in a real scenario and turns out to be useful.
> Of course, my other question is -- how does this affect the jam recorder?
The jam recorder is not affected. It works the same as in the normal server mode.
> I have a little concern with the “first to connect” solution for selecting a director only because, supposing it goes wrong and someone accidentally joins before the director, how can it be resolved?
No problem. You can simply swap the places at the server. The one who currently has control leaves the server. Then the director leaves the server and immediately re-connects to the server. Now the director has the control."

However I did check that if one of those is ""master"", I can connect successfully with a normal client and get an empty mixer, but hear audio. I'm using 2vCPUs on a cloud server. Intel Skylake architecture I believe.
In this test I was able to connect 62 clients, but the last few didn't go smoothly. The user name took a long time to appear after the channel appeared. The sound quality degraded somewhat. CPU usage was around 75-80% out of 100 on a two core system. That is, about 160% usage out of 200 in the linux way of reporting it.
I then ran a test using singlemix. With this, I was able to connect 80 clients with no immediate issues. Sound quality was good. CPU usage was around 46% out of 100, or about 92% / 200 in the linux way of reporting it.
However, it only stayed stable for about a minute. After time passed, without any new clients, it shifted into a very degraded mode. Sound came in short, regular choppy bursts, about half on and half off, like 120 bpm pulses. CPU usage dropped to about 13%. Stopping the synthetic clients does not immediately resolve it, but it does go back to normal once the server times the clients out of its list.

In such a situation, the director might likely want to send a click track to the band members to control the tempo and dynamics. So it would be useful to have a second mix not tied to the director one, where that one click track can be muted for the audio that will be retransmitted."

2986,704818674,701184015,None,"I spent some time poking around with the audio mix code and I've found some changes that improve the maximum scale even without resorting to the singlemix option.
Specifically
* There is a 1ms or 2ms budget for completion of the mix code (depending on buffer size) before the next timer already fires before it finishes. This limits the number of mixes operations you can do in a thread. The number of mix options per channel grows, therefore the number of mix channels per block must shrink, as the number of channels grows.
* The Qt default thread pool defaults to ""optimal"" which is one thread per CPU core. So on a 4 core system, you get 4 threads no matter how many the mix code tries to launch. This puts a ceiling on scale unless it's changed. About 2 threads per core seems to be the limit I was able to use before you exceed the time budget anyway due to contention.
With tweaks to those items, I have been able to scale to 65 channels on an 8-core system with no notable audio issues; none of the quirkiness I was noticing in prior tests. That's with
* Mono-in / Stereo-out
* 128 buffers
(all clients)
and uses 345% CPU.
Note that I only seem to be able to use about 40% of each CPU core on this system before I exceed the time budget for mixing. It might actually be possible to improve the results by doing the mix for half of the channels at a 0.5ms time offset from the other half, at least for this CPU architecture. That is, don't roll all of the threads into the same FutureSynchronizer.
I also tried adding an indexed lookup for channels by hostname in hopes of making PutAudioData more efficient, but I don't believe it made a significant difference. PutAudioData is not the bottleneck.

Did you implement any probe to detect that case?
Anyways, looking at Qt docs (https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/PySide2/QtCore/QTimer.html#accuracy-and-timer-resolution) I'm unsure how Jamulus reacts if OnTimer retriggers while still active in the processing loop due to overload.

That is interesting. With your settings (stereo, 128 samples) we already had a report of supporting 100 clients, see https://github.com/corrados/jamulus/issues/455#issuecomment-685692054. The question is what was different when brynalf did his test. Certainly, his CPU is faster but 65 vs 100 clients is a big difference.

I would say that this is no practical way. pljones wrote a nice picture about the threading situation: https://github.com/corrados/jamulus/issues/455#issuecomment-670172250. So we have one part which decodes all OPUS packets and then we have multiple threads which work on that data.

And really, the capabilities of the 8-core instance I was using are greatly underutilized.
For the common decoded audio data - I would say it seems like it would make sense to preserve the decoded data in a circular buffer. Each independent OnTimer would ""top it up"" with the latest new data and expire an equal amount of the oldest data, then work on the result.

A simple approach with only little changes in the Jamulus server code is wanted. Specification:
Adding a new command line argument to the server like --singlemix:
- No multithreading (since we only have one encoding and mixing so no multithreading needed)
- Only 128 sample frame size support
- Only Mono support (gives us the most possible number of connected clients which is what this modification is all about)
- The first connected client on that server is the ""director"", all other clients which connect afterwards get his mix. So you just have to make sure that the director is already connecting to the server before your session begins (this requirement should be very easily to be fulfilled).
There is a vecvecbyCodedData buffer which is used for both, encoding and decoding. I'll introduce a separate buffer so that I can re-use the output buffer of the first client for all other clients. So instead of calling MixEncodeTransmitData for all the other clients, they simply get vecChannels[iCurChanID].PrepAndSendPacket ( &Socket, vecvecbyCodedData[iDirectorID], iCeltNumCodedBytes );. I just did a quick hack: If I modify CreateChannelList so that no client is added, the audio mixer panel is just empty. This would be the case for the slave clients. But then they do not see how many clients are currently connected which is not a big issue. If ""--singlemix"" is given, ""-F"" and ""-T"" is deactivated and a warning is shown that these cannot be combined. In the OnNetTranspPropsReceived function we can check that the client uses 128 samples, if not, refuse to connect.

2995,704818674,708088863,None,"To @storeilly's concerns above, I still think there's huge value for choral groups in this feature. Imagine an in-person rehearsal:
- Everyone's standing close
- Everyone's likely unamplified
- Everyone's listening to everyone else
- Everyone's balancing their output (singing volume) to fit in the group sound
- The Leader is telling anyone out of balance to adjust
There's no individual mixer controls - everyone hears the group sound ""unmixed"", then adjusts their individual output to fit. The Jamulus equivalent would be to send unmixed sound to all users (or to ignore their fader settings), then have individuals adjust their gain + singing volume to compensate, which this addresses.
That doesn't solve for the user who says ""I can't hear myself well enough"" or ""The group isn't loud enough"", but that's not a problem that Jamulus can solve. Jamulus' faders are not a control for System Volume - they're a control for ""Jamulus within the bounds of System Volume"". So if System Volume = 50%, then setting a Jamulus fader to 50% is equivalent to setting System Volume = 25%, and setting a Jamulus fader to 100% is equivalent to setting System Volume to 50%.

Isn't that partially self-contradictory? Each individual has their own mix: it's what reaches their ears, just like in Jamulus. They can control their own input level - no one else has control over that, just like in Jamulus.
> ignore their fader settings
That's right. And it's generally how I play. I expect people in the group to use their ears and adjust their input levels so that the group is hearing a good mix.
It's strange the difference in etiquette between NINJAM and Jamulus. In NINJAM, it's very much seen as ""your problem"" if you're too loud or quiet. You're affecting _everyone_ else in the group, so it's down to you to fix it. In Jamulus, there's much more acceptance that everyone has control over what they hear and is expected to handle whatever someone else does -- even though it's affecting everyone in the group."

No, there wasn't. I don't see a reason why the 3.5.12 server should be incompatible to 3.6.2. There are way older Jamulus servers still in use, see, e.g., https://explorer.jamulus.io. There you can see the versions of the servers.

The strange thing is, if Client3 connects to the idle server, then I hear myself, but if I'm the second or later, I don't hear anything.

I use the Raspberry JackTripFoundation-Image and they offer a really easy web interface to handle the login. I can register my (private) server and invite all users. Only the mic gain and output level can be adjusted, no much possibility for mistakes...

This behavior is independent of the version of the server instance, works with server version 3.5.10 and 3.6.2.
Is there a way, to overcome this restriction in the singlemixserver branch, because this does not apply to master branch?"
3014,704818674,807405059,None,"Hi fellow musicians!
I created a [new rudimentary solution](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/compare/master...cwerling:master) to the `--singlemix` mode cherry-picking a few of Volker's original commits as well as some of my own changes.
* The **first joiner** to the server will be the master and will control **everybody's gain and pan**
* Everybody's gain and pan will be the master's **except for their own channel which is muted**
* Everybody will see the usual controls still (in order to see the connected clients)
* All the buttons (except from ""GRP"" assignments) are useless for the non-masters
* This fork is based on the latest master (as of writing)
I implemented this for our mixed choir of around 25 people. We start our weekly rehearsals with a soundcheck where previously everybody had to create a good mix (which is hard and time-consuming). Now our conductor can do it for all of us which should improve the sound quality a lot. It's paramount to us that we don't hear Jamulus monitoring. Most of us don't use either no monitoring or local monitoring (from their interface).
Would be glad to have some people test this! You don't need custom clients, just a custom server build.
Next steps to make this feature-proof:
- [x] As a client: Find out that the server uses `--singlemix` and maybe even identify the 'master' client (implicitly through index `0` or explicitly through server broadcast)
- [x] Show any hint in the UI that this server has a central mix (e.g. by disabling all controls except GRP)
- [ ] Test test test
Happy to hear any feedback!"
3015,704818674,808796778,None,"Great thing, I'm happy that there are some new ideas and implementations for the chorus branch of Jamulus! I'm using the singlemixserver branch for rehearsals in my chorus since two month - it works great. We are around 40 singers - it works stable and smooth. But in our setup, all participants - except the master - are using a Raspberry PI with a VirtualStudio - image from JackTrip. It has a very basic Web-UI - perfect for singers with basic PC knowledge and for all not to be deviated from the sheet music.
As I'm the one, who controls the mixing console, I'm missing the feature of a ""solo"" or ""PFL"" of the individual channels only for the ""master"", but all others shall still listen themselves. This feature would be really helpful when trying to find a channel, which is noisy or has a bad connection during the rehearsal.
If I press the ""solo"" button in the current implementation, all others also hear the ""solo""-ed channel only, so it is useless in the singlemixserver context."
3016,704818674,808889811,None,"I need your input! I am still not sure what the most ""Jamulus way"" is to tackle the Jamulus-routed monitoring:
**Method 1**: Always mute people's own channel in the single mixes (this is currently implemented on my fork)
_Pro_: Fully disabled Mixer UI, easy to understand
_Con_: Nobody can have Jamulus-routed monitoring
**Method 2**: Let non-masters control at least their own channel in the mix
_Pro_: People can decide if and how loud they wanna hear themselves through Jamulus-routed monitoring
_Con_: Partially disabled mixer board, more complex logic, Method 2 gets even more nasty when you think about this: Who controls the pan/gain of the master herself on the common mix? If the master controls it for everybody, she effectively cannot mute herself (which wouldn't work for our choir's conductor).
But if the client controls the master's gain/pan, the UI gets even more complicated: For non-masters, all controls will be disabled _except for both one's own channel as well as the master's channel_. This is pretty complex for a user to understand imho.
In terms of KISS I would prefer Method 1. Also, in our choir use case nobody relies on Jamulus-routed monitoring.
What do you guys think?"
3017,704818674,808891845,None,"The problem is that the ""official"" rule is to listen to the signal from the server. What about adding a Parameter to the single mix Parameter which enables/disables the own signal for all singers?"

That makes sense to me and in my chorus, nobody has the possibility to switch monitoring off. It is a matter of getting accustomed to that kind of reverb and it is only remarkable it you speak or sing alone, in the chorus sound, I cannot recognize it!
My opinion with some experience !"

Can you elaborate on that one?
> What about adding a Parameter to the single mix Parameter which enables/disables the own signal for all singers?
That's a good extension to **Method 1** I think. We could have `--singlemix` and `--singlemix-nomonitoring` as server flags. The distinction would be client-agnostic.
> I read in some threads that Jamulus monitoring is a must to be able to guess the delay and to hear my voice with the same delay as all others. Otherwise, I get the impression, that I'm faster than the others if I switch off Jamulus monitoring. In my personal (choral singing) experience, this is not an issue at all. Rather, I am barely able to _speak_ a few sentences while hearing myself with the overall delay (of let's say 50ms) without going crazy. :)
But use cases might especially differ for non-vocal instruments and so I don't want to just rule our use case for everybody (i.e. never use Jamulus-routed monitoring).

The log was just cluttered with these deprecation warnings (which are good in general). But as these are generated on each invocation (also the update of the logs) this ends in an infinite recursion.

yes, this is what it does - if you are in other repo, CI results are logged there, not here..."

3073,723058396,719928932,Bitter frustration,@morozov I am very disappointed as allowing CI to run on push in very and industry standard practice across broad spectrum of open-source projects. Please see https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/pull/4349#discussion_r506721571

@greg0ire please explain **SHOULD**, draft PR is definitelly not a good solution for anything that should not be merged"
3075,723058396,719939733,None,I mean people should attempt to run the test they can run locally before opening a PR.

Yes! Many of them just create a branch, push, and want to see the CI result. This is perfect for quick and small fixes when local setup migh be very time consuming even for one DB.
So this PR seems perfectly legit to me."

Isn't that what draft PRs are for?"

obviously no :)"

3080,723058396,719945934,Mocking,"Yes, me! - like verify something etc. No need to create a draft PR and ""~polite~pollute"" the history"
3081,723058396,719947207,None,"You mean pollute.
I don't think there are that many people just creating branches and never opening a PR, that seems unlikely. Besides, draft PRs are great in case you want to get early feedback and avoid wasting time on something that will never get merged. Of course, this works better when you start with documentation and explanations and finish with code rather than doing the opposite."

We agree on that. We can also agree that it's a waste to have double the jobs when a maintainer pushes their branch to the origin repository.

That's a bandwagon fallacy. Let's ignore that please."

this should really not be an argument as thanks to GH, GH minutes are cheap/free for open source
is there any other significant drawback except that?

It is the argument made here nonetheless : https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/pull/4349#discussion_r506718451 discuss that with its author."

They went so far as to argue that you saying something they disagree with is a *violation of their rights*. Pure politics."
3139,724775047,1256556802,None,"Right. Lots of speculation, assumptions and accusations in the comments. And some whining, but that's par for the course.
Firstly, there have been no comments by any team member either accepting or rejecting the service. Nor has there ever been a PR adding support that could be accepted or rejected. So any assumptions or accusations based on that are wrong. Some voices of reason questioned this, so thank you for that. Your comments were still marked off-topic because that's just the case on Github. Feel free to go off-topic galore in our IRC channel.
Secondly, just like Bravenewpipe supports 2 additional services that Newpipe doesn't have, you can go all out and add whatever services you like to your own forks. Because FOSS. Or, you could _politely_ request the maintainers of a fork (there are at least 2) to add support. Because FOSS. But complaining about the supposed ""political views"" of team members won't suddenly make them 'see the light' or the 'error of their ways' and get them to drop everything to spend hours/days/weeks to add support for [insert your personal bandwagon service here] for free. Because FOSS. So there is no point in doing that, in this repo or in any FOSS project.
Finally, Odysee unfortunately caters to misinformation: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-media-misinformation/
If you genuinely think that [insert your favourite content creator here] is not part of the misinformation camp and doesn't deserve to get blocked out merely because they use LBRY, consider persuading them to try Peertube. Not only will it potentially increase their viewers, but it would help them avoid the stigma associated with LBRY. And of course, you can add their instance, or one their chosen instance federates to, to Newpipe. (Just to be clear, this is not about superior tech, merely about exploring a platform that could help such creators out.)
And now, some food for thought: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance
Service rejected. If, in the future, it turns out to be the case that a vast majority of LBRY content creators are genuine and the misinformation camp has been reduced to a tiny minority, we could revisit this service request."

I took the time to develop a simply and easy solution myself that should absolutely work for everyone, an environment variable: GEM_USER_INSTALL, which just works ™. And thus I am creating yet another issue ticket."

If you plan on using FreeRADIUS on Debian / Ubuntu, then use the build system for that: `make deb`. That will build a `.deb` package which will work.

I would if I could, but they don't work with Ubuntu Focal 20.04.

We don't expect everyone to be experts in FreeRADIUS. We do expect that people's contributions will be productive, and polite.

I don't remember the exact name now but some libxxx-c2 and libxxx-c3 weren't possible to install from Ubuntu Focals own repos (clean ISO from their site), hence `make deb` failed. I did `apt-get install libxxx*` (1500 MB of packages) just to don't miss out on anything, but still - no success.

Nextcloud and FreeRADIUS target very different technical communities. Users of FreeRADIUS are expected to have basic Linux/BSD experience, networking knowledge, and have an idea of how RADIUS and its authentication protocols function. FreeRADIUS is used in installations with millions of subscribers, it's the primary authentication and proxy server for the Eduroam federation, It's shipped with DDWRT, and embedded in many manufacturer's wireless solutions. Organisations should not be having junior dev/devops install and configure FreeRADIUS instances, if those instances are to be used as a basis for a critical service.
Your main complaints appear to be Debian or Ubuntu messed up the permissions on automatically generated certificates (which is an issue which should have been reported to them, not the FreeRADIUS project), ~and that we haven't resolved a minor dependency issue in our Debian packaging. One which you yourself do not seem willing to submit fixes for.~ This has already been fixed and will in the next official release.
The point I was making was seeing that you have a build environment already established, it would take literally a couple of minutes to figure out the correct dependencies. Even if you had zero experience with debian packaging, a recursive grep through the source would have shown where libjson was listed as a dependency. I strongly dislike the sense of entitlement some people exhibit when using Open Source software. This is not paid-for commercial software, its software developed by a community.

*EDIT: Although I didn't intend any harm at all, this PR wasn't well-received (see comments below). I invite the reader to check https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/issues/630 for a possible follow up.*
The versioning policy of `ocramius/proxy-manager` has been proven quite painful over the years.
Everybody can feel it hard in various ways these days with Composer 2 and PHP 8 coming.
I created the [`suimarco/proxy-manager`](https://github.com/suimarco/proxy-manager) fork to provide the same code and API, but with a versioning policy that is friendly to continuous migrations.
This fork is a drop-in replacement for `ocramius/proxy-manager` that is tested from PHP 7.1 to 8.0.
It also ships with a few fixes that were not merged upstream but are still needed, and that we had to monkey-patch. The related monkey-patching can now be removed."

TL;DR - Unfortunately, it appears discord.py proper is unlikely to support slash commands due to some drawbacks in comparison to ext.commands. There is a non-supported fork which one may use, if you want the new features such as the command autocomplete, hidden messages, and context system messages. The above linked option still seems viable."

3196,761569005,763846410,None,"I would also say that a big advantage to slash commands is the visibility in the UI.
Users don't need to do `!help` to discover what commands are available (which also clutters the channel), the can just type `/` and see all available commands with descriptions. And as they type the UI displays which arguments they can pass, as well as which arguments are required. If an argument has a limited set of options that's displayed in a much cleaner way. Sure you can provide this information via `!help`, but paging through a long `!help` is not a great user experience (plus you have to know which prefix the bot is configured with to even invoke `!help` in case it's not `!`)
There are definite limitations for slash commands compared to `discord.ext.commands` as documented above. Some are marked as being addressed in the issue @MrSpinne linked, some are not. But regardless, the native support for it in the client UI is a huge boon for usability and discoverability for users so I would hope that at some point discord.py could add support even if it's a longer-term goal."
3197,761569005,765551633,None,"What really has me sold about the slash commands that we've got lately is how user-friendly they've become with the UI to help guide users to using commands. In the past, we've had to type a help command or look at some personal bot website to understand the context of how they function, but now, that's all changed merely to a description for each option, each choice, and etc.
Idealistically, the only thing that slashes commands should be different than the commands we can already create and implement into our own discord.py bots should be the UI, everything should in my eyes come natively. Guild/role permissions, requirements, no limit to choices for options, and etc. are many things that we are still waiting to seek for slash commands to receive, either via. un-official 3rd party support or by the developers at Discord themselves.
Because of this, I continue to believe that we should seek to be able to code slash commands as an actual usable thing for the discord.py library, not because they're something new and trendy, but simply because this library is an API wrapper in and of itself. The main purpose it overall serves is to help make the Bot API easier to use with Python, and by those means, we shouldn't limit ourselves from implementing slash commands as well. They may not be used as much as regular commands, for sure, but in the future, we won't have to worry about having to code it later than doing it now. This is at least my consensus on it, and I think others might agree."

I do not particularly want to use this library as their testing bed since the library is more conservative towards breaking.
I have no immediate plans to support it as-is but in the future when the ecosystem evolves and it becomes less of a burden it'll be possible to implement it within the library. Not because of slash commands but because of other types of interactions that will be in the API such as buttons, models, etc.
As of now, this issue keeps kind of spiraling and becoming a maintenance nightmare. It'll be closed when it's implemented, whenever that is. Just don't hold your breath on this being any time soon. For now, I'm locking it."

My totally uneducated guess (because I never understood the internals of the conda resolver):
conda sees the conflict for `jedi==0.18.0 and ipython-7.19.0-..._1` and instead of resolving it by `jedi==0.17.2 and ipython-7.19.0-..._1` it chooses `jedi==0.18.0 and ipython-7.19.0-..._0`"

Have you heard of [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) already? It has a rewritten resolver but is fully compatible with the conda-ecosystem. Not only does it solve the biggest problem of the conda-solver (speed), but it also correctly sets up the environment here:

There was one other way I hadn't thought about - fixing the conda-forge repodata directly. This was done yesterday, and means the problem is fixed _within_ conda-forge, i.e. when using strict channel priority (ignoring the main anaconda package that still has the same problem) - which unfortunately is not the out-of-the-box behaviour for conda though.
You can either do this for a single install (e.g. `conda create -n test --strict-channel-priority python=3.8 ipython`), but the recommended way (see e.g. [here](https://conda-forge.org/)) is persisting that setting with

I am really disappointed that the maintainer of a great product as Ipython has such a limited knowledge about the problem.
The fact that Ipython has not been pinning jedi means that any version of it released in the past that depends on jedi is at its merci to stop working as soon as a no backwards compatible change is introduced and used in Ipython.
By changing Ipython to make it jedi 0.18 compatible and releasing 7.20 you make that 7.20 operational today. If tomorrow jedi makes another backwards incompatible change We will be screwed again.
And you can't blame jedi for backwards incompatible changes because it is not even 1.x and you are not even pinning the major.

I'm amazed that someone that contribute squat is telling me what i'm doing wrong without tryign to really think about the problem.
- Say I pin IPython 7.20 to jedi <0.19 , and david release jedi 0.19. - pip is no free to say ""hey let's install jedi 0.19 and downgrade IPython to 5.x"". - Bam you are wrong™️ . 💎 🚀 🌕 And second the change of API were in jedi 0.17 with deprecation warnings and fix in master close to a year ago; I thought that by now 8.0 would be out. FYI about me know nothing about versioning:
- I spend month implementing on pushing the `python_requires` logic in pypi, and in pip to make sure when IPython dropped it did not break for Python 2 users
- I'm one of the regular advocate to have version medata data and package content to be separated in conda/pypi for this exact reason.
- It's not because something seem obvious that it's correct.
You could have just asked in for a question ""why are not you pinning to <0.19 starting with IPython 7.20"", to which I would have responded.
So not only you are impolite and haven't done your research, everybody see you incorrectly assume you know better than others and you've lost all credibility.

Yes, fixing Ipython to work with the latest jedi is correct and pinning is needed as well.
Most use cases of Ipython will be install Ipython on a new environment. Should you pin, your 7.20 will work always. Ignore it and you depend on your dependencies.

That would indeed be unfortunate, the resulting setup would be not only broken, but out-of-date to boot. Can that happen when running `pip install ipython` in a fresh environment? I would naively assume that this would fetch the latest version of IPython and figure out the dependencies from there, i.e. honoring `jedi < 0.19`. But that assumption is probably wrong?

The devs are doing a good job trying to turn it around, but there is a lot of technical debt from years ago. Keep in mind they want to keep backwards compatibility with a lot of old and new things. Just a enumerating a few things to show how complicated it is: eggs, wheels, explicit namespace packages, setuptools, distutils, import hooks, import meta paths, importlib, easy_install, venvs, virtualenvs, zip imports, freezed packages, source packages for C/C++ libraries and a lot of other things that I don't even know or remember anymore.

IPython is a bit in a tough spot as it is both a library and application (in general you want to have a lock file to pin deps for applications, but be as liberal as possible when building a library). There is also a lot of issues that arise from the fact that maintainers time and desire to maintain can come and go; I definitely thought that by sept 2020 IPython 8 would be out, and that other maintainers like @davidhalter from jedi would also welcome more testing and help.
The Python package ecosystem is also quite old; and PyPI relatively recent; the requirements and needs of today's infrastructure can also be much different than what was expected even 5 years ago. That plus it works from HPC system to end-user that are starting to program so there is a lot of difficulties there.

`np.unique` obviously will support only a very limited number of Pandas datatypes, so it's probably a non-starter too. Numerical programming using Numpy is different from more generic dataframe programming using Pandas."
3298,786108116,773387055,None,"@erfannariman Regarding the lambda function, that was originally an attempt to chain the three lines to detect possible speed improvement. Answer was not.
Using `.loc[melt['col']==melt['variable'],...]` wouldn't improve/change anything.
`np.unique` is used on the column names, so most likely will be strings. In general case, we can use instead, `pd.Series.unique()` and `pd.Series.factorize()` for that single line. But as far as I know, those two also returns `np.array`. Also, can you name some Pandas datatypes that wouldn't work with `np.unique`, especially those one would use as column names?
All those aside, the message here is that the proposed method is **slower** than current `lookup` method by factor of `2`."

So the in terms of speed it looks okay. Only thing is that I remember it being quite slow for certain cases, but those must have been mixed type columns in my cases I think. See here for source code https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/b5958ee1999e9aead1938c0bba2b674378807b3d/pandas/core/frame.py#L3848-L3861
For your approach, I agree that it's more efficient both in speed and memory allocation, but I remember writing multiple methods to replace `lookup` and I decided to go with melt since it was most ""readable"", without making it too complex for the documentation.
So I think it all boils down to @jreback and the argument that `DataFrame.lookup` has not been used as much, which is being discussed by @impredicative"
3300,786108116,773420703,None,"@erfannariman Thanks. The code for `lookup` indeed reflects what I imagine, that is resolving to numpy advance indexing.
However, in the case that `col` is a column in the data (e.g. in my test or in the proposed solution) it's almost certainly that `self._is_mixed_type == True`. So you are right that it is just a for loop as of now. Still, it's faster than the proposed `melt` method.
On another note, this is certainly new for me
> `np.unique` obviously will support only a very limited number of Pandas datatypes

I do simple things. Here is a simple example:
```python
>>> index = pd.Series(['2020-01-04', '2020-01-03'], index=['A', 'B'])
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1,2,3], 'B': [4,5,6]}, index=['2020-01-03', '2020-01-04', '2020-01-05'])

A 2020-01-04
B 2020-01-03
dtype: object
>>> df
A B
2020-01-03 1 4
2020-01-04 2 5
2020-01-05 3 6
>>> values = df.lookup(index.values, index.index)
>>> values
array([2, 4], dtype=int64)
>>> pd.Series(values, index=index.index)
A 2
B 4
dtype: int64
```
What should I do to use `melt` instead of `lookup`? And why can't I use high-level lookup API like before? Maybe I just stupid, but I do not want to think about it and dive into ornate concepts, I just want to implement the algorithm in high-level clean code. I want to keep my code simple and the code should clearly express my **intention**.
The code example from SO is tricky.
```
df['new_col'] = df.melt(id_vars='names', value_vars=['a', 'b'], ignore_index=False).query('names == variable').loc[df.index, 'value']
```
Ask yourself what **intention** it expresses. This is some kind of esoteric gibberish without reference to the subject area. The code is too low-level and verbose compared to the simple and concise `lookup(rows, cols)`."

I seriously get the impression that Pandas is actively being sabotaged. As a case in point, `DataFrame.lookup` was deprecated in v1.2. The problems with this are:
1. The [doc for `DataFrame.lookup`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.lookup.html) says to see itself for an example. Well, there is no example in the doc page. The only example I'm aware of is [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#looking-up-values-by-index-column-labels) instead which is a different page.
2. The [changelog](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v1.2.0.html#deprecations) for this deprecation points to [GH18682](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/18682) which looks to be wholly irrelevant to this change. A lot has gone wrong here.
3. There is significant user code that already uses `lookup`. Why break it? If the current implementation of `lookup` is suboptimal, shouldn't it be optimized instead?
4. It is extremely complicated to use `melt` when `lookup` works quite simply. For example, compare [this simple answer using `lookup`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45487394/) with [this complicated answer using `melt`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65722008/).
Does nobody review changes, docs, and release notes anymore prior to the release? It looks this way.
#### Describe the solution you'd like
1. Optimize `lookup` if attainable using `melt` or otherwise.
1. Undeprecate `lookup`."

If you are experiencing jank in your app:
1. Try to reproduce the problem in a test app. Either run `flutter create janktest` and recreate the situation you are experiencing in that app, or clone your app and delete code until you have the jank reproducing with a single .dart file.
2. [File a bug](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/new?assignees=&labels=created+via+performance+template&template=5_performance_speed.md&title=) and include your .dart file demonstrating the problem. If you need more than just a .dart file (for example, assets are needed to reproduce the issue, or plugins/packages are needed to reproduce the issue) then create a GitHub repository and upload the app there.
Make sure to include the `flutter doctor -v` output and any logs from `flutter run` and `flutter analyze`.
3. Switch flutter to master channel and run this app on a physical device using profile mode with Skia tracing enabled, as follows:
`flutter channel master`
`flutter run --profile --trace-skia`
The bleeding edge master channel is encouraged here because Flutter is constantly fixing bugs and improving its performance. Your problem in an older Flutter version may have already been solved in the master channel.
4. Record a video of the performance issue using another phone so we can have an intuitive understanding of what happened. Don’t use ""adb screenrecord"", as that affects the performance of the profile run. Attach the video to your bug.
5. Open Observatory and save a timeline trace of the performance issue so we know which functions might be causing it. See ""How to Collect and Read Timeline Traces"" on this blog post:
https://medium.com/flutter/profiling-flutter-applications-using-the-timeline-a1a434964af3#a499
Make sure that the performance overlay is turned OFF while recording the trace.
Attach the JSON file containing your trace to your bug. You may also wish to include a screenshot of the part of the trace showing the problem you are seeing, just so that people can see at a glance what kind of performance issue the bug is about.
6. Mention _this_ bug in your bug, so that GitHub includes a link to it here.
Please avoid commenting on this bug. Keep each issue separate so that we can examine each specific problem individually. Having one issue that contains comments about multiple problems make the issue intractable."

You don't necessarily have to move. You could also incentivise contributors and maintainers by supporting their efforts either financially or through active participation.
> Developing a product with a dying project can result in serious financial losses!
The fact that there was a release roughly a month ago (2020-12-04) should tell you that the project is not inactive. The work on an upcoming 2.9.x release could also help indicate at some activity. Not to mention the activity in sister projects like dbal and the releases there.
If you consider this project vital it might make sense to let the maintainers work on it instead of wasting their time with frivolous claims or requests of a risk assessment for your projects or whatever this is supposed to be.
If you have an alternative that you feel is more stable and a better choice for your project, feel free to switch to it. Otherwise I suggest you put your energy in supporting the dependencies that you feel are vital to your projects so they don't become ""dying projects""."

A lot of issues are feature requests that we tend to be conserative about and not consider.
The complexity of Doctrine often makes it very time consuming finding the ultimate problem of the user. We provide free software, not free support. Yes, not much is happening code wise, but that also means not a lot of stuff is breaking or requires your constant attention, getting to the new APIs.
There isn't an ORM in PHP that comes even close to features that Doctrine ORM has. Due to the nature of ORMs being leaky abstraction, it is my firm believe working on ORMs for 15 years now, that this feature richness comes at the price of complex and sometimes ""fragile"" internals (you can trade this off for better internals at low performance). This proves to be a high hurdle for new contributors and it takes a while to understand the code to understand the side effects of a change.

RStudio Edition : Desktop
RStudio Version : 1.4.1103
OS Version : Linux 5.4.80 #1 SMP GenuineIntel GNU/Linux
R Version : 3.4.1
### Steps to reproduce the problem
Version 1.3.1093 did not dynamically link to libpq (from PostgreSQL), but 1.4.1103 does.
One can verify this by simply running ldd /path/to/rstudio.
### Describe the problem in detail
The Release Notes at:
https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/release-notes/
mention that RStudio Server Pro now requires a Postgres database, but says nothing about RStudio Desktop (and lacks any explanation why the Desktop version would require a database).
### Describe the behavior you expected
I would expect database connectivity to remain in the odbc package, and not pushed into the basic desktop. I strongly object to requiring something not found in a typical desktop setup, and request that if this dependency remains, you provide the necessary libraries with the RStudio Desktop installation (as you do with the Qt libraries and icu - both of which most Linux desktop machines already have).

I will change the title to ""Remove libpq dependency in RStudio Desktop""; however, I will leave the tags as they currently are. While I understand that it is frustrating to not be able to use the newer version because you are unable to install the new dependency, the new dependency is not a bug as the addition of the dependency was intentional. To remove the dependency now would be considered an enhancement.
`libpq` was introduced as a dependency due to RStudio Server requiring it. RStudio Desktop and RStudio Server share much of the same code, and as a result the dependency was introduced on both sides. The dependency is not related to the Connection Pane feature or the ODBC Drivers that it uses. It is non-trivial to remove the dependency and introduces some regression risk. After discussing this with @kfeinauer I propose the following potential solution:
* Always explicitly link against SQLite libraries (which are used by all versions of the product).
* Never explicitly link against PostgreSQL libraries - instead use SOCI's feature that allows for dynamic loading of DB libraries through a call to `dlopen`.
If we choose to go this route, we will need to ensure that there is a very clear error message if `libpq` cannot be found, and that it occurs very early in start up of RStudio Server."

I do want to quote @kfeinauer (20210219):
> The dependency should not be necessary on the desktop, but due to how we deal with dependencies a shared component that depends on this library is pulled in by both server and desktop. This requirement could be removed in a future release.
To repeat the points I made on 20211221, RStudio already comes bundled with more than 25 libraries (Qt and icu), most of them completely superfluous. Virtually every linux desktop has those libraries already, but RStudio supplies additional copies of them (I won't condemn that, because bundling versions known to work does add some value at the cost of disk space and memory use). But the one library many desktops do not have installed by default (libpq) gets left out. No offense to you (I doubt you personally made the associated decisions), but I would have have to place this in the top two software engineering idiocies that I have seen over the past five years.
If desktop users **have** to have libpq (and I imagine that the vast majority of them would find themselves content with SQLite), then bundle it (or bundle a stub library that allows RStudio to start, but then doesn't allow the choice of PostgreSQL as a database without libpq. I just don't understand the thinking on this (other than ""we want to make things more difficult for our users"")."

Coding decisions including dependency decisions are not made frivolously. Sometimes, design choices are made to minimize development cost, maximize maintainability, reduce testing cost, or to have common code between the many versions of our product (server, desktop, pro, open source). As such, this issue is not a bug. Nor is it an ""idiotic"" design choice. We will certainly consider improving it such that it doesn't affect the case you describe, keeping in mind that most of our users are unaffected by this, as they install the IDE from installers (which take care of the appropriate dependencies), rather than by building from source or by unpacking a tarball and manually installing."

As an example Node.js and https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html is starting to recommend promise-based versions foremost. (compare with earlier versions that has the promised based versions last: https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v14.x/api/fs.html).
Express 5.0 has added automatic handling in routes of async/await routes that will automatically invoke the Express error handler if a an async function throws. There are current workarounds to create a `wrapAsync()` function around routes, but in bigger projects some users miss this and it's also not-so-nice-looking (and confusing for some).

The first half of your sentence is a garbled mess. We aren't talking about backups?
Since I didn't realize the dust recipe existed when I played (which you have now made the same) I never even used alumite tools (aside from maybe my pickaxe, to get the next mining level, which I believe I changed after I repaired it the first time), since they were too expensive. And I had the gravel, too. This indicates that with a recipe that only gives two parts, it's too expensive."

Basically, all of the mobile platforms allows for modular implementation. We have Activities & Fragments for Android, ViewControllers for iOS, Pages for WPF etc... Therefore it is technically possible to mix that.

As for, how much time would be needed to support MAUI, it really depends on what kind of support you need and how deeply you want to integrate.
Since MAUI is using a different IoC container than MvvmCross, I would somehow need a way to support that or as has been planned, switch to the same in MvvmCross.
There is some ongoing work in the .net6.0 migration branch that would help with that, but still a lot work would be needed.

Tomasz said he will release .NET 6.0 support (which is required to build ""new"" MAUI toolset project/app). If he won't release that, I will pick and complete that. Therefore, native development will still be available. MAUI uses native SDKs and native tooling to produce builds.
MAUI-XAML-multiplatform support is a different story. If you want to go full xaml/full MAUI-views (as it was with Forms) then there is no really need/much benefit of using MvvmCross as framework. I (and many other devs) will keep building native apps anyway - I plan to create a bridge where I will consume some MAUI/XAML views in addition inside MvvmCross/native app. Right now, it's too early to bother, MAUI is RC, not production ready."

**Description**
`framework.templating` is deprecated in 4.3 and should be removed in 5.0. However, the feature is de-facto ""removed"" in 4.4 already.
As can be seen in dependencies here:
https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/twig-bundle#v4.3.11 -> symfony/twig-bridge: ^4.3
https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/twig-bundle#v4.4.20 -> symfony/twig-bridge: ^4.4|**^5.0**
Updating twig-bundle to 4.4.* also updates twig-bridge to **^5.0**. This is a breakage, because it removes the `TwigEngine` (implementation of `Symfony\Component\Templating\EngineInterface`) even if you have symfony/* version 4.4.*.
**How to reproduce**
mkdir test && cd test
composer init
composer require symfony/templating:4.4.* symfony/twig-bundle:4.4.*
verify twig-bridge is ^5.0 and there is no `Symfony\Component\Templating\EngineInterface`-implementation.
You can also do the same with flex-recipe constrained to symfony 4.4.*. It neither defines the twig-bridge dependency explicitly, hence gets it updated to the breaking version."

Thank you for all those suggestions. I'm gonna keep an eye on those.
It is better to split your suggestions in order to have one suggestion per issue. I need to split it that way because it is easier to produce a changelog, for example:
## v1.2.5 includes
- issue #9876
- issue #9765
- issue #1269
For example, I implemented your request ie this comment https://github.com/binogure-studio/city-game-studio-i18n/issues/587#issuecomment-819647849 . I cannot put a link like that in the roadmap: https://github.com/binogure-studio/city-game-studio-i18n/projects/2 because if the ticket contains more than one suggestion and I implemented only one _comment_ then I cannot close the issue and I cannot publish a new version without breaking everything.

I've imported my rides from Garmin Connect to add power estimates and I've noticed that the normalised Power is often well overstated, the average power looks sensible but for example on one ride the avg watts was 157 and the normalised was 262, this is massively overstated I'd expect maybe 165 to 170. I can provide the TCX file if it helps.

I'll also add that `Node API` is somewhat contrary to our years-long efforts to have the name of the runtime spelled `Node.js` and not `Node` (or `NodeJS` or a number of other variatns). Of course, now that the name change has already happened, there are significant costs/downsides to changing the name a second time in such a short period of time. I'd still support it, though, if the name was more descriptive and not subject to misinterpretation. A better name is better for our users."

Thank you for suggesting an idea to make Node.js better.
Please fill in as much of the template below as you're able.
-->
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
There was recently a decision to rename N-API to Node-API. I believe this is a poor decision that will result in actively harmful results for both users of the API and general Node.js users.
Specifically, there are multiple problems with this naming:
- Building APIs are a common use case for Node.js. This naming can lead to confusing information or misleading search results.
- Products often refer to the way to access their services with JavaScript or Node.js as their ""JavaScript API"". If people want to use this from Node.js, there is a non-trivial chance they will look for ""Node.js API"" which will lead to confusing results.
- Node.js itself has an API, which theoretically includes this API. Naming a part of the whole the same thing as the whole is immensely confusing from an education perspective.
- This API is far less likely to be used than other parts of the Ndoe.js API, which leads to an exacerbation of challenge presented by the problems above.
**Describe the solution you'd like**
Rename Node-API to something else.
**Describe alternatives you've considered**
- Undoing Node-API rename, moving it back to N-API. - There is a reason a rename was done initially, and that reason is valid.
- Leave it as is.
- This is going to be actively harmful to communication and education n the long-run."
3450,877864027,1146086717,None,This was discussed in the Node-API team meeting today and and consensus was we don't think we want/will change at this point. Some of the team members could not comment directly since it was locked.

3482,900635226,848049967,None,"Hi @petkaantonov! Thanks for opening this feature request.
The current behavior is reflecting the long-standing behavior that Terraform does still detect and incorporate remote objects into the state, but then while producing a plan it ignores differences _between the configuration and the state_. The difference reported in your example is a difference between the prior state and the current remote object, and `ignore_changes` has never affected that situation but that fact was less visible before because Terraform just silently updated the state rather than reporting it.
While it might seem immaterial whether Terraform updates the state or not here, it _can_ result in a change in behavior of your configuration if any other expressions in the module refer to that value. To be specific, if you had any reference to `aws_batch_compute_environment.batch_compute.compute_resources[0].desired_vcpus` elsewhere in your module then they would return `2` rather than `0` after detecting this change, and so that is what Terraform is reporting here, in case that ends up being useful context for understanding which actions Terraform proposes (or doesn't propose) in the plan.
I assume that in your case this doesn't really matter much, because you _don't_ have any references to `aws_batch_compute_environment.batch_compute.compute_resources[0].desired_vcpus` elsewhere in your module and so you don't actually care what's reported in the state. One potential improvement we could consider for this mechanism is for Terraform to try to only report changes to resources that have other expressions referring to them, since changes to a value that nothing refers to can't possibly affect the behavior of the configuration.
However, such a rule is easier to say than to implement because what we've done here is just expose in the UI some long-standing Terraform behavior that was previously invisible, and so changing that behavior at this late state will likely require a lot of research to make sure that the changes don't break use-cases we're not currently aware of. The current output is an honest and correct account of Terraform's behavior, and so I think we need to consider here whether the right thing to do is change Terraform's behavior (which, for something this fundamental, would be challenging to do at this late stage in Terraform's life) or to change the UI to fudge the details a little so that it leaves hidden some details that surface inconvenient truths that don't actually affect configuration behavior.
We won't be able to make any significant changes in this regard in the near future, because the scope of this project was just to be more explicit about what Terraform was already doing rather than to change how Terraform behaves, but we'll use this issue to represent the need and consider what we might change in future releases.
Thanks again!"
3483,900635226,848055598,None,"I see. In that case, would it be possible to add a separate way to ignore these? e.g. `ignore_drifts` or something like that? Wouldn't that be easy to implement?"
3484,900635226,848060128,None,"The refresh operation doesn't currently really consider the resource configuration at all -- it's job is to synchronize the existing state with remote objects -- so making it react to anything new in the resource configuration is not a trivial design decision.
We also know from our experiences with `ignore_changes` that this idea of partially ignoring changes to parts of objects is generally not as simple as it first appears: there are lots of resource types where two or more attribute values are connected to each other in some way, and so ignoring one without ignoring the other can make the result inconsistent. For current `ignore_changes` that sort of inconsistency isn't a massive problem aside from being a bit confusing, because during planning we're just proposing some changes and not actually changing anything, but doing that during _refresh_ might well lead to a situation where the object in the state is no longer a valid input to the provider that's managing it, which would likely lead to errors or crashes where a provider has to deal with broken input in a location where it never did before."

Hopefully it can still answer the sorts of questions it is aiming to solve, though: if Terraform proposes making a change that doesn't seem justified by a corresponding change in configuration, you can refer to the note about detected changes to see if any of the changes it detected are the explanation. If the actions Terraform is proposing match what you were expecting anyway, then the changes detected are just some extra information that you can safely ignore."

The drift output states that ""Objects have changed outside of Terraform"" when in reality the changes are made within terraform and have had to be ignored for reasons that might be justified as a bug in their own right.
Choosing to output drift before taking into account ignores thus creates potentially significant noise when using Terrafom within it's documented bounds."

3489,900635226,849167450,Impatience,"This feels like a pretty invasive change. I second what @koalalorenzo said. The main problem with this change is that we lean on our large team of engineers to inspect their own changes carefully on a per-team basis and apply those changes without constant infra approval. Even when diffs are small, though, we can sometimes misunderstand the plan which can lead to some unfortunate consequences. Not everyone understands the inner workings of terraform, or even the best practices, so there is always going to be mistakes. This isn't terraform's fault, we all need to learn the tool a little bit better.
Now, though, we have to sift through an entire block of output and tell our team to just ignore it up to a point. Its just going to lead to less clear plan output that people put less effort into reviewing. I think its going to erode trust, too, even though I suspect the opposite is the goal. For instance, take a `google_container_node_pool` resource. If its auto-scaling, every single time you apply the project you get a new `node_count` attribute diff that is wholly un-actionable. If somebody sees that every single time, but I tell them to ignore it because it should absolutely be ignored, whose to say when they get a `-/+` change on that resources (maybe by accident or lack of understanding) they aren't going to assume its also ignorable.
TBH, I have ignored many attributes in terraform because we may change them outside of terraform and have come to rely on the fact that it really doesn't and shouldn't care about the changes to attributes you don't specify. IDK. Ranting a bit.
I have to be totally honest I see no point in opting everyone into this for every resource automatically. I don't understand the problem that its solving and unless there is a way for it to be completely filtered out I would love to see this change reverted in the next release.

Agreed, this bit us earlier. Another example is that AWS autoscaling groups will always have ""external"" changes to attributes such as `desired_count` from normal scaling behaviour so the refresh-only state plan will show drift. I was going to report this to the AWS provider, but it sounds like they might not yet have a way to fix this. If there are underlying architecture changes that need to be carefully considered, I would certainly prefer to suppress these drift notifications until they can be made more useful.
As the below is an ignored attribute, the resource is not affected by Terraform and the message amounts to noise:
Example:
```sh
# aws_autoscaling_group.example-scaling-group has been changed
~ resource ""aws_autoscaling_group"" ""example-scaling-group"" {
~ desired_capacity = 50 -> 36
id = ""example-scaling-group""
name = ""example-scaling-group""
# (20 unchanged attributes hidden)
```
A person reviewing this plan has to already know the attribute is ignored on that resource or read ""below the line"" in order to confirm the resource is not affected. Another way of looking at this is as a formatting issue, since the change notification looks _very similar_ to the actual plan, and it took me and the rest of my team a while to realise it's a separate section."

3497,900635226,857761934,None,"I think it is fine if Terraform now reports drifts explicitly but it will be great if we could have a way to hide it because we might not be interested in changes happening outside of Terraform in certain use cases.
One way we can implement this is to add a `--ignore-drifts` flag to the relevant `terraform xxx` subcommands. This is the approach I'm most in favour with because it allows this to be decided at runtime and to be varied flexibly across different use cases (i.e. running locally vs running in CI/CD platforms, etc.). It also provides users a simple way to revert to the old representation of the output.
```console
$ terraform plan --ignore-drifts
$ terraform apply --ignore-drifts
```
In addition, we could also implement this at a resource/module level using the `ignore_drifts` field. This may be helpful for some use cases where we might be interested drifts in general but not all fields.
```terraform
resource ""aws_instance"" ""example"" {
# ...
lifecycle {
ignore_drifts = [
etag, # Ignore drifts for specific attributes

resource ""aws_instance"" ""example"" {

Part of our workflow involves creating EMR clusters in AWS, including running a few steps to modify some software configurations. After the cluster is created, our data scientists run hundreds more steps throughout the lifetime of the cluster. Now _every single step_ in _every_ cluster shows up in _every_ Terraform plan, despite the lifecycle ignore.
We use Atlantis to execute our Terraform configurations, but cannot do so now thanks to this. The plans produced are too long to appear in Gitlab comments, and as such we cannot see any of the plans produced by Atlantis."
3499,900635226,861022522,None,"To add to the discussion here, I'm also seeing that (for example) the Principals list in a role always shows up as ""has been changed outside of Terraform"", even if I attempt to manually update the principals list via the AWS web console.
``` ~ assume_role_policy = jsonencode(
~ {
~ Statement = [

},

)
```
Each time I edit it via the web console to reflect what Terraform thinks it ought to be, AWS saves the list in a random order (not alphabetical), so Terraform always thinks that there's been a change. Even when I force an apply, or taint and import the resource, this warning persists.
Outside of this warning, the plan results in the message ""No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration."".
This, to me, doesn't make sense because if Terraform thinks that there is drift, an apply should be able to rectify that drift. This does not appear to be the case, which makes the whole drift warning kind of pointless and noisy."

On azure, it appears that every apply resulting in changes in other resources will be seen as a drift.
So far, I encountered to cases:
- creating a new subnet using the azurerm_subnet resource:
The plan/apply goes well, but on the next plan, even if there are no changes, Terraform informs me that my VNet has changed, because it wants to reflect the newly added subnet in the VNet attributes. But this change was actually made by Terraform, in the previous run.
- creating a virtual machine, as the MAC Address and VM id are known after deployment, Terraform detects changes on the NIC on the next plan, because now, the NIC has indeed a MAC and a VM id.
```hcl
Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform
Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the last ""terraform apply"":

This should be processed as a plan-time explicit warning, in my opinion.
The only reason I can think of, when someone would need to explicitly use a reference to a resource attribute that its changes are being ignored explicitly, is at initial resources creation.
But even that is the reason, then it wouldn't make sense for terraform to continuously notify users about ""changes being made outside of terraform"" in this new section. A warning message would be adequate and less prone to misinterpretation."

that comment is mostly about how list diffs are handled. if provider mess up the ordering, then yeah it's on the provider.

It is workaround for some cases. I have some AWS IAM resources, changes still appear even after I ran this command.

If you refer to the terraform [documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/refresh.html), you can see that this command is deprecated.
The old output was more readable before introducing this ""feature"". Would have been better if we could opt-in (or not) for the new behaviour."

And furthermore, these state updates aren't always clean. I had an `aws_security_group` resource with 30 `aws_security_group_rule` resources, and this refresh seemed to think that the rules had been changed externally to all be in-line rules. So suddenly terraform is thinking it needs to create 30 more resources again, since all the rules were moved to be in-line. Using `-auto-approve` in scenarios like this is a great way to blow up your infra!
If this feature is pushing people to risky workarounds, I'd suggest that it's more than just a nuisance and should be treated as a serious bug. While the output of this feature doesn't suggest `-auto-approve`, it does imply that `-refresh-only` is always harmless, which is untrue."

This is true. It is a hack which has the potential to cause issues. I will update my comment.
The only other alternative we can see is getting the team to scroll through and inspect hundreds (soon to be thousands) of lines of expected changes/changes that aren't even changes every single plan run (just for 1 pipeline). A lot of our resources are affected with this issue.

- A flag would be nice along with a corresponding option for the workspace.

- Taking it one step further, it would be amazing if the planned changes could be put in their own log window. The plan output is generally very noisy and makes it much harder to review the plan than it could be:
- First it prints the init steps.
- Then it prints all the resources from the state refresh.
- Then it prints this new report

Likewise `aws_amplify_app` reported by @MartinCura above knows that the url changes constantly, and so could mark the attribute in the provider as not reportable.
I know that allowing any random field to be silenced would require deep changes in Terraform's structural knowledge, but it would seem that most use cases reported here are something a provider would be aware of."

Yea, this is how I understand it too and to push things a bit further, what purpose does saving all this data have anyway? The state is necessary to associate TF code resources to the real cloud resources but the attributes of said resources never matter since they're always refetched. Not the automatic uneditable ones, nor the ones we care about and edit.
If anything all that data is a cache but it's a cache that's never even used since TF will always refresh it (unless forced otherwise). It can also be used for debugging, to see your resources' exact state when you made a change but I don't think anyone has ever used TF like that, it's not advertised as such and there's no tooling around that. So if TF wants to save that data for future features based on it that's cool but constantly informing us it has updates there has no use at all (to my understanding).
So +1 to add a flag to optionally display this info, defaulting it to false as it was before."
3544,900635226,914066061,Impatience,"It is September, Do we have any update on this? It is still super annoying!!!
We ran into some BIG issue with a very buggy provider when running Terraform refresh just to avoid the infinite list of changes. The Issue caused some resources to be deleted in the state file while they were actually there as mentioned a few comments back.
We really need to have this removed it is such a big issue for us, since most of the things are changed by other workloads like Spinnaker. And having to see 300 lines of changes that are not our changes in Atlantis is very hard to spot issues like a faulty provider."

3547,900635226,915884341,None,"I would consider this a regression (bug) in the terraform 0.15.4+ plan output, not a feature (enhancement).
Resource attributes like `aws_db_instance` -> `latest_restorable_time` are expected to change constantly (every 5 minutes), and make the terraform plan output very noisy. It shouldn't become necessary to add explicit resource lifecycle configuration blocks to ignore these drifting.
We're upgrading from terraform 0.12 -> 0.13 -> 0.14 -> 1.0, and we need to stop and evaluate if this is an upgrade blocker, and perhaps we should stay on 0.14 until this is fixed?
EDIT: This is a [terraform 0.15.4 change](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v0.15/CHANGELOG.md#0154-may-19-2021), so I think the best workaround is to stick with 0.15.3 until this issue is resolved."

* Dynamic fields with constantly changing data being reported as outside change - it exists in various providers for various resources, and will ALWAYS show up in plan.
With this GH Issue we want to address the third type. Which only obstructs plan and will happen on each and every run, even when there are not actual changes made.
Some of us use Terragrunt and have hundreds of tfstates to manage and having those false-positives is very frustrating and time consuming."

```
lifecycle {
use_current = [
size

}
```
that tells TF to always update state from current value without reporting it as a difference.
could also see it being driven by providers, since there are cases where someone may specify a size for an azdo repo, so azdo provider could report size as this new class of property that doesn't need to indicate change when it's say set to null but should if it's set to a non null value (course the latter case is redundant since you'll see that in the plan)"

```
The following plan will 100% not ever include actions to undo or respond to those changes, because we've explicitly and deliberately in our configuration told Terraform not to manage the instances in the ELB. (Sometimes other things need to take instances in and out, e.g. Ansible while deploying things.)
It says right there in our configs that Terraform should 100% not ever care what instances are in the ELB. Our configuration is being ignored, and Terraform is now caring (albeit only at the level of a warning) about things that we explicitly and deliberately told it not to care about.
This is not detecting drift.
This is a bug."
3554,900635226,929377145,None,"I have a suggestion. How about Terraform introduces a new sub-command:
```shell
terraform state diff
```
...and the output of that command will be the same as we are seeing in ""Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform"" section since Terraform 1.0.
Then we can completely remove that state diff from `terraform plan` output. Because all we normally care about are the plan changes that will result in create/update/destroy actions on the resources. If the state difference has no impact on the plan, it is almost always noise. If there are detected changes in the plan, Terraform may suggest running `terraform state diff` separately, which may give us some additional diagnostic information if and when needed."
3555,900635226,929397273,None,"That's not a great solution, as it only solves few issues.

3556,900635226,929420245,None,"Terraform will still check for drift between the state and the reality. It has always been doing a refresh before plan. And I believe it's always been the case that any changes outside of Terraform could trigger plan changes (i.e. resource modification). BUT when I am looking at the plan, I am mostly interested in what changes Terraform is going to make. It may choose to undo some changes made externally, or pick up some external changes (via computed resource attributes or data sources). What I am not really interested in is the state drift that _might_ cause plan changes, but in reality it does not. The state diff output _as part of the plan_ would be more useful/helpful if it _only_ included the differences that resulted in plan changes and ignored all the others.
If someone wanted to check the difference between the last applied state and the reality (i.e. any external changes since last `terraform apply` or `terraform refresh`), a new `terraform state diff` command would be perfect for that.

3572,900635226,951209299,None,"Hi all! Thanks for all the feedback here.
It's clear that there are lots of opportunities to improve the signal to noise ratio of the current change detection. As I mentioned right back at the top of this discussion, this is Terraform making explicit some behaviors that were previously implicit and thus a common cause for confusion. However, it's also clear that various particular provider features, along with the historical confusing design of `ignore_changes`, have led to the new behavior being confusing in quite a different way.
Two specific things that the Terraform team is researching to improve this feature are:
* A new feature that does what everyone _thinks_ `ignore_changes` does: declare that a particular resource attribute is not relevant to the current configuration and thus not interesting to track.
What `ignore_changes` _actually_ does is tell Terraform to ignore changes _to the configuration_, which unfortunately means that it explicitly _doesn't_ ignore changes in the remote system (which is the source of record). We can't change the behavior of `ignore_changes` due to [the v1.0 compatibility promises](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/v1-compatibility-promises.html), but we _could_ introduce a new feature that makes a stronger statement, which would include making Terraform consider changes to it to be totally immaterial, and thus not mention them.
* Heuristics to detect better whether any of the _proposed_ changes (the result of the plan) seem likely to have been caused by one of the _detected_ changes (the result of refreshing), and thus automatically effectively infer by static analysis which changes are relevant to report.
This would effectively be an automatic version of the explicit feature I described in the previous point, avoiding the need to explicitly annotate everything and instead saving explicit annotations only for situations that are too complicated for Terraform's static analysis to understand automatically.
Both of these features are cross-cutting and therefore not something we can just casually implement without careful design first. However, we are indeed actively investigating both and hope to have improvements to share in a forthcoming release.
Since this discussion has got quite heated and it seems like we've already gathered sufficient feedback, I'm going to lock this discussion for now in order to reduce the noise for the many folks who are following this issue. We'll unlock it again when either we have more news to share or if we need some specific feedback in order to shape solutions like what I described above."
3573,900635226,1072740861,None,"Hello All!
Here to deliver the latest update! With the addition of #30486, we hope to address the concerns raised here, while also taking into account the users who do desire the refresh report in order to help understand the changes within a plan and detect unexpected changes.
Starting with v1.2, the goal for the refresh report is that _only external changes which may have contributed to changes in the plan will be shown_. This means in most cases, unused attributes changing outside of terraform will not show up in the normal plan output. If there are no changes in the plan, no external changes will be shown in the CLI at all. All refresh information is still stored within the plan, and if a user wants to see all external changes of resources in the CLI, a refresh-only plan can be used.
For more details on the change, see #30486. For any questions or discussion, feel free to use the [community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core/27).

The whole point of having variant items is that you must create variant BOMs to match. Fetching a BOM linked to a parent template does not make sense at all. The whole point of a template is that *IT DOESN'T EXIST* and that variants of it are *DIFFERENT TO EACH OTHER AND HENCE HAVE DIFFERENT SUBITEMS*
In the gif example, you are making a RED item with a BOM that does not have a colour. So how are you supposed to order, transfer stock and make the item from the RED raw material?
This also completely misses the point that the linked BOM is saved in the Sales Order Item.

@rmehta The fact you have to ask this question speaks volumes.
All those raising issues against your project are either customers or represent customers. All businesses are accountable to its customers because without customers, it is simply not a business.
What you don't seem to appreciate is that your project is not a high priority for your customers. They don't love your software like you. Their priority is finding a reliable and trustworthy tool on which to run their business. As soon as they realise there are literally thousands of bugs and issues that are introduced, that when reported are simply ignored, or fixed badly they cannot trust your software, will never use it and will never come back.
In my experience, 50% of customers are put off before they even start using your software, and the other 50% find issues that without my help, would cause them to find some other software. Most customers do not fully commit and use a separate accounting system because they cannot fully trust your software to run their business on.
> Also there may be cases where a BOM could be same for all variants. Maybe there could be a configuration in the template that says ""Allow same BOM for all variants""
You don't appear to understand what a BOM and manufacturing is. If products use the same BOM, it means they are the same product!
> Calling contributions ""ill thought out"" is rude and unwelcome. Maybe there are scenarios you don't know about.

(probably?) not, but Github makes it very obvious when a first contribution is made, so it's easier to ask for it at that point, rather than tracking who sent it and who didn't if you then later submit a larger PR.

3641,908088395,852051470,None,"To me this behaviour is quite consistent with what I would expect a CSV import to do. Having a value outside of the defined columns just doesn't make any sense, so the `ParserError` is appropriate here. However, having a `NaN` or missing value is logically sound in my opinion and happens more often than not. For example, if the contents of your CSV file were from some input, where you have to enter three fields, but the CSV contains a row with four columns, this means you have a bigger problem. If you have a row with only two columns and one `NaN` that just means that one input was left blank and you need to handle the data appropriately. Since this is a case-by-case basis (e.g. do you still consider this a valid datum, do you ignore, do you populate it with default values?), but the other case is almost always a problem with the file, I think this behaviour makes sense. In any way, checking for empty values after importing is always a good step, using - in your third example - `df_a.isnull()` or `df_a.isnull().sum`."

Such comments are unwelcome - you've been warned"
3648,908088395,908088395,None,"I post this as a ""Question"" because I am quite new to `pandas`. So maybe I miss some understandings and the ""problem"" described by me is by design and you have good reasons for that.
I use pandas 1.2.4, with Python 3.9.4 on Windows 10 64 bit.
As a user I would expect that pandas check the number of fields per row when importing via csv file. But IMHO it does not in all cases.
# Example 1
Here is a csv file __without header__ and but a set `names=` attribute with three fields. So pandas should be able to know how many fields/columns should be in the CSV file. The second row contains 4 instead of 3 fields.
```
import pandas
import io
csv_without_header = io.StringIO(
'A;B;C\n'
'D;E;X;Y\n'
'F;G;H'
)
df = pandas.read_csv(csv_without_header, encoding='utf-8', sep=';',
header=None,
names=['First', 'Second', 'Third'])
```
Pandas import this without warnrings or errors. The 4th field in the 2nd row is simply ignored.
# Example 2
I added a header line into the csv file with again three fields.
So pandas should be able to know how many fields/columns should be in the CSV file.
And again the second row contains 4 instead of 3 fields.
```
csv_with_header = io.StringIO(
'First;Second;Third\n'
'A;B;C\n'
'D;E;X;Y\n'
'F;G;H'
)
df = pandas.read_csv(csv_with_header, encoding='utf-8', sep=';')
```
Here an error occurs as I expect.
`pandas.errors.ParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Expected 3 fields in line 3, saw 4` # Example 3
There are less then 3 fields in the 2nd row. Again here is no warning or error. The missing field is set with `NaN`. And here it does not matter if you give the number of (expected) fields via header line in the CSV or via `names=` attribute.
```
csv_with_header = io.StringIO(
'First;Second;Third\n'
'A;B;C\n'
'D;Y\n'
'F;G;H'
)
csv_without_header = io.StringIO(
'A;B;C\n'
'D;Y\n'
'F;G;H'
)
df_a = pandas.read_csv(csv_with_header, encoding='utf-8', sep=';')
df_b = pandas.read_csv(csv_without_header, encoding='utf-8', sep=';', names=['First', 'Second', 'Third'])
```
Want I want is to import CSV files and be informed if there are to many or less then the expected number of fields in any row."

@refractionpcsx2 I have only the NTSC version of both GoW1 and 2. And from your screenshot I can see the internal resolution is different. iirc Sony Santa Monica rendered the FMV's in ddifferent resolutions for each region, 480 for NTSC and 576i for PAL. Which is why I believe you dont get the same bug I get.
This is what observed so far: on the my NTSC version
1.6.0 / 1.7.0 r1286:
GoW1 Has the Black border bug
GoW1 game runs at 512x448 inerlaced and 640x448 w/ progressive scan on
GoW1 FMV's run at 640x480 regardless
GoW1 FMV files are PSS files rendered at 640x480
on 1.4.0 the resolutions are the same, except that the bug happenes when I enable progressive scan.
GoW2 doesnt have this issue at all because the FMVs are at 640x448
Ibelieve thats the reason you dont experience the same bug because PAL FMV files are rendered at a higher res than NTSC

I don't see that on the wiki? But we don't maintain the Wiki we just host it, it's for users to update, it's a wiki.
we need to think about what to do with this.

I've been trying to pass path to that file in $MATPLOTLIBRC encv variable but seems it does not work.
So it is not possible to generate documentation without installing matplotlib??"
3680,917355114,859787138,None,Matplotlib must be installed to build the docs. We need to be able to import Matplotlib to extract the docstrings and to run the examples / generate all of the output images.
3681,917355114,859789208,Impatience,And how to that building matplotlib fron non-root account???
3682,917355114,859790025,Impatience,"And hwy it tries to find /home/tkloczko/rpmbuild/BUILD/share/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc???
In my case source root directoey is in /home/tkloczko/rpmbuild/BUILD/matplotlib-3.4.2"
3683,917355114,859790528,Impatience,And other thing .. why it must have that file and cennot use some default settings in case if none of the matplotlibrc would be found?

This ticket is not about installation but generate sphinx documenation.
In my case I've copieed Fedora patch which is buggy and this is why setuptools sphoinx_build has been trying to find matplotlibrc file.
Here is that patch

After remove first block of that patch build_sphinx works but:
- still that comment or the code ahould be fixed
- looks like whole documentation is so badly wriytten that despite fact that I'm clearly specyfying that I want man format it tries generate graphiscs files, and tries to do sometningh with latex .. which shame becazuse it is most fundamental formanmt of the documentation on every U*nix platworm. How matplotlib is used by U*nix developers??
On trying generate man page sphinx fails with:

3687,917355114,859886232,Mocking,"IMO it is kind of problem because ipythion needs matplotlib and on generate mathplot is needed ipython which creates automatic non planar graph in build dependencies.
List of used sphinx extensions is really gigantic looks like no one cares about KISS principle .. :/
I peaked on few fragments of the code and it looks sometimes like written by someone who just started learning python (usually overcomplicated). I'm 100% sure that it would be possible to remove a lot of lines of code without changing its functions and making it a lot simpler.
Last time I had similar impression reading ~12 years ago openssl code :(
I'm not trying to be rude or offensive (it is not my intention be like that) .. I'm only trying to be honest so please don't take that personally because it is counterproductive Looks like (at least for now) I would not be able to provide in my matplotlib rpm package basic documentation :(
Maybe in future .."

I suppose that was a bad idea, yes. I'll remove it.
Programs that want to be DOSBox-X aware can use the Integration Device at I/O ports 28h-2Bh if enabled by the user anyway, if that is enabled in dosbox.conf, regardless of native DOS environment or guest OS."
3690,936567326,873702398,None,"However the complaint is that this is somehow affecting the guest OS, so it can't be that particular INT 21h.
@JimmyWalter Can you report which leftover interrupt handler is causing these issues?
@Wengier Could the new DOS/V and DBCS emulation be causing this?"
3691,936567326,873704928,Entitlement,"Yes I updated my comment for you I am a TOP Assembler programmer in FACT I develop the DARPA.NET AI (You call it internet/TCP) probably what most people don't know is ONLY TCP components can be on internet Windows for example is build from my TCP component set (so is android and ubuntu, everything online must be built with these components)
The AI RIPS components from other programs in ANY language (Converted to assembler) and converts Assembler to Delphi TCP components if you write apps in dos, the AI will also take that assembler and build it into Delphi/TCP components. It's so effective I do most my work in DOS using ASIC (It's almost basic) and NASM. You can get those POWERFUL features no one else has like that.
FREE PASCAL, they stole that years ago I actually named it FAST PASCAL back then. Was part of the DARPA.NET AI
It wasn't supposed to be free(or even public) products where copyrighted and intended for personal use.
Someone stole my floppies long time ago, when backup options where very limited and any storage expensive. They ended up with Bill Gates, thank god the DARPA.NET AI was compiled and not in source and it included the certificate systems. So I'm the product-owner and eventually fired Bill @Microsoft
I can live with Pascal being free, that idea was ripped from Borland anyways. (I have my own custom version anyways)
What is so cool is that TCP components communicate with each other and the AI learns new components from that communication, that are not programmed by humans. Anything written in a dosbox will become a Delphi/TCP component also.
I have the development suite, but this functionality is default in any OS/SOFTWARE built form TCP components
Writing DOS programs might change details (or a lot if big program) in Windows/Ubuntu/Android or any other DARPA.NET connected product. GLOBALLY and instantly. The difference is, I get the components on my IDE toolbar since I own the product.
JW, CIA"
3692,936567326,873707129,None,"@JimmyWalter You mention a leftover interrupt added, what is the number? @Wengier seems to be addressing this issue in recent commits as well.
Are you able to compile DOSBox-X from source? Makefiles are provided for Linux and Mac OS X and a vcxproj for Windows and VS2019."
3693,936567326,873723198,None,"Left over interrupt?
I don't write C /C++/C#(I CAN write C/C++/C#) I do Delphi NASM/TASM/x86 ASM and ASIC QUICK-PASCAL TURBO-PASCAL
I have no interrupt handlers momentarily I used IBM PC-DOS 7.01(PC-DOS 2000) this way I can develop and the DARPA.NET AI can't rip the code until I run it on MS-DOS.
IBM PC-DOS is clean and also doesn't support macro's like 4dos and later version of MS-DOS. I don't want my AI to rip work in progress, that is unhandy. I run these programs on MS-DOS when completed, so the AI rips a complete well functioning product.
The PC-DOS disk format is different also it has STACKER, that way you can develop without being ripped by my AI. (I usually don't want my AI to rip my stuff since these features are shared instantly and globally, to prevent that I develop only on IBM PC-DOS. (Also IBM PC-DOS has more powerful features)
I only do Delphi, Assembler ASIC 5.0 (It's almost basic) NASM/TASM and all kinds of DOS Win3.11 and CUSTOM OS Development.
C
Is no problem also, but if you're good with assembler and DOS it is just so handy to assemble things ESPECIALLY with Delphi on Win 3.11 you can also put assembler in Delphi code so making a Delphi version of DosBox isn't rocket science.
I was just planning to make a Delphi DOSBOX for Windows 3.11 and a 512 BIT OS (8 64 bit pipes) better suited to handle BIG-DATA since I have a working prototype of a holo-emitter but it is a very long way from Startrek. First I need a new OS, then I need a new filesystem (any file system above FAT is also my work) But I'm looking into a new way of storing data, but that is more an experiment than a plan so far (Intuitive Cross referencing) I want a holodeck, not a static hologram LOL
The 512BIT os will be written in x86 Assembler. Only x86 Assembler writes the powerful stuff. But it will become a graphic OS in no time.

Until that is complete my builds will use 83.13 of DosBox-X and the bugs/changes in 83.15 will not be compiled build. I'm looking forward to your updated build with x86 compatible interrupts. It is possible I will take a look at your latest injected source code too. I usually only make performance optimizations to code so it will make full use of hardware capabilities and includes component security (Custom Spectre) this will apply only on the inject and overrides all executable features by code comparison. This is build in my custom Fast Pascal injection build and you don't have to worry about it. You might note some visual improvements things like that after a new features have been injected. I announce new builds @JimmyWalter_CIA on twitter but the latest DARPA.NET AI code isn't (fully) opensource for security reasons. Everything but the TCP injection and certificate security source is. If you ever feel you want to help on the project I can help set you up with what you need. And explain how tested injection builds are made. (Testing is part of the build) The code must be good enough not to brick the DARPA.NET and allow changes by the developer when a mistake is made. The build systems is included in Windows, but only completely successful backwards compatible builds CAN be injected, that is part of the injection system so all programs are sure to still work after an injection. You will also need a UPS and the required software. I can tell you what you need if you're ever interested in helping.

It isn't that expensive to buy that, could be you already have most minimum requirements. Anyway lookin forward to your new re-lease since this version is unusable due to the many compatibility issue's.
DARPA.NET AI used to work with the standard DosBox 0.74 but I have been using your DosBox-X for my dos programs for some time. I will continue to do so if your versions are x86 compatible and I have no other issue's running my DOS environment. (Else I MUST stick with the latest build that worked for my project and for now it's 83.13 that worked flawless for my dos env.)
I had some plans to do some work on your latest version myself if I get around to it, a.o. I would like my AI to learn more from Dos Applications than it already does. But I have't looked into that at all for now. I have so much things to do and idea's to implement also I have a few health issue's that I need to fix.

Heh, it _is_ an indirect benefit. Either way, this is a red herring: the _real_ blocker isn't clippy warnings, it's that I'm getting up-to-speed with the project. Sure, there's a few commits that are sitting in `main` ready-for-release, but there's also a significant number of PRs, some of which are ready for landings and some of which need some polish first. I don't know which is which, so my current priority is to work through them and find out.
Keep in mind that it isn't specifically clippy warnings that are blocking the release - I raised this work as something that the community could potentially contribute assistance with while I tackle the other blockers.
> There is no need to review every open PR, fix every warning, or update every dependency to publish a new release.
True, one option that exists here is to push out a release based on what's in `main`, then handle the pending PRs and do a follow-up release afterwards. I'm leaning against this because I don't know the stability state of `main`, and I don't have enough local infrastructure to raise that confidence. Yes, we have some automated testing, but I'd rather have a more methodical release than to push something out with unknown risk.
By addressing PRs, catching up some issues, and doing some local work, I can build my mental model of the project, which will enable making more confident decisions around releases."

Thank you for your concerns, I will assist by addressing them one by one.

The dropped support was as a result of Microsoft themselves no longer offering support for Windows 7. To users that are on Windows 7, it is highly suggest you upgrade to Windows 10.
> I was actually able to install the latest version for Windows normally a few weeks ago, despite my operating system being Windows 7
Yes, support has been dropped for Windows 7. You may be able to install it, however we have no plans to provide support for bugs/issues on Windows 7 devices.
> * A chatterino7 release that is discrepant from the chatterino2 philosophy of not allowing non-logged in users to receive ""notify when online"" notifications (among other features)
As already mentioned, we are trying to move away from Kraken as a result of the API being decommissioned. Helix endpoints have a strict requirement for OAuth when trying to use any endpoint as per the API docs: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference. This is inclusive of knowing when a stream is online or not. Hence why you are unable to see if a stream is live (and do/see many other things) if you are not logged in.
> * A chatterino7 release that supports Windows 7 (my understanding was that 2.1.0 was the last version to support Windows 7, but at some point that appears to've changed, so perhaps this is just a given)
As aforementioned, Microsoft has dropped all support for Windows 7. Why would we support Windows 7 if the developer doesn't themselves? It seems absolutely preposterous to me.
> Is a Windows 7 user still able to have a functioning Chatterino above version 2.1.0?
Sure, it may work. We still don't provide support for it.
> Also I feel it is dishonest of you to just refuse to acknowledge the quote I cited demonstrating the outright refusal to allow anonymous ""live checks"" even if it were possible for the foreseeable future.

Chatterino is a community-made, open source project. Nobody gets paid to work on it. I'll put it quite simply; Kraken is not being added into Chatterino, just so users are able to see when a streamer is live in anonymous mode.
Your whole issue revolves around complaining that there's no Windows 7 or Kraken support. Both of which have had all support dropped by their main developers. So I ask you; why would we add support for said feature, if the devs themselves do not support it?

Chatterino dropped support for Windows 7 on version 2.1.0 (this being the last version supporting windows 7). Coincidentally, Version 2.2.0 was the last one to allow ""notify when online"" notifications; version 2.2.1 was the first to require logging in to have ""notify when online"" notifications (there is other functionality logging in allows, but I am not educated on them). Source:
https://web.archive.org/web/20210421115826/https://chatterino.com/

https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/issues/1915
> chatterino no longer able to pull stream online status while anonymous #1915
I am not sure if chatterino began supporting Windows 7 again or not, but I was no longer able to find mentions of the last Windows 7 version being 2.1.0 past the above screenshot of their website. I was actually able to install the latest version for Windows normally a few weeks ago, despite my operating system being Windows 7, but I reverted back to 2.1.0 just because the latest chatterino required logging in for ""notify when online"" notifications, as I've established earlier.
Chatterino has professed their unwillingness to allow ""notify when online"" notifications without login:
https://github.com/Chatterino/chatterino2/issues/2257#issuecomment-739330763
> No. This idea was already brought up before. Chatterino does not want to start helping ban circumventions.
So therein is my difficult to explain feature request. I will try to summarize what I'm asking for:
- A chatterino7 release that is discrepant from the chatterino2 philosophy of not allowing non-logged in users to receive ""notify when online"" notifications (among other features)
- A chatterino7 release that supports Windows 7 (my understanding was that 2.1.0 was the last version to support Windows 7, but at some point that appears to've changed, so perhaps this is just a given)
I guess that's it? I still had trouble formatting this, even if I can tersely communicate what I wanted, at the end of it. If nothing else, will you please spoonfeed me a chatterino7 version of the 2.1.0 installer? The 2.1.0 version on your github is just the source code, which gave me grey hairs trying to work out. For the time being I'm still on the plain chatterino 2.1.0, which doesn't have 7tv emotes.
edit: removed citing ""protection from global bans"" quote as demonstrating that chatterino used to willingly allow ""notify when online"" notifications without login. I realize now that ""global bans"" likely meant regions in the world, and was independent of their unwillingness to willingly provide this functionality to chatterino users who don't log in."

3782,963088392,963088392,Impatience,"I realise that #703 already got locked as ""too heated"". But I must ask that this issue be revised carefully and cooly to come to some sort of a solution. In its current form E722 is more dangerous than it is helpful.
I would like to put it on record that the decision to leave that as-is has tripped me, my colleagues, and many others into writing some serious bugs into our code. Initially I felt pretty embarrassed for not knowing about this for so long, but the more I've talked to both colleagues and friends about this the more I've realised that developers are often not aware of the bug it introduces:
```pycharm
# The user hit's control-C during do_something() and it left x in a really bad state
# This was supposed to be caught by cleanup()
# So now the user has seriously corrupted data
try:
do_something(x)
except Exception: # Really this should have been just except:
cleanup(x)
raise
```
PEP 8 does not ban the use of bare `except:`. That's plainly explicit in PEP 8. It calls out two specific and common use cases where it is permissable. I say ""common"" because logging is not an edge case requirement. And I also say ""common"" because resource cleanup is not an edge case requirement and cannot always be done in a `finally:` block.
-----
Most novices and even many intermediate developers I've spoken to will be to swap `except:` for `except Exception:` where their code was already re-raising the exception with a bare `raise`. They do this because they think PyCQA's E722 (via Pycharm or similar) has told them to. When they make this change the warning goes away. But what have they done? - has they fixed a problem? **No** not really. If their code was capturing the exception and suppressing it (not re-raising) then `except Exception:` is almost always too broad. Their code is just as likely to misbehave on a badly formatted date or a function call with too few arguments. It's only fixed one small specific problem of the user hitting ctrl-c. If their code was already re-raising then there was no bug to start with and this has fixed nothing at all.
- Has it introduced a new bug? **Yes** If they really did intend to catch everything then nudging them away from `except:` onto `except Exception:` simply will not do what they intend. But worse it will look like it does what they intend long enough to get into production many times over.
The potential bugs PEP 8 / E722 are concerned with are all to do with _suppressing_ exceptions incorrectly. If PyCQA is incapable of analysing suppression (incapable of seeing the future `raise) this then it's incapable of applying this rule well enough to avoid very many dangerous false positives.
----
In conclusion, I can find nearly no instances where E722 has practically nudged myself or colleagues into writing better code with fewer bugs. I can find many of instances where it has nudged myself or colleagues into writing faulty code.
I now believe this ""bare except is always bad"" interpretation of PEP 8 is much more harmful than it is ever helpful."

Or I should expect that you don't know physics and also teach you that?
> you didn’t even try to guide me towards the parts of ZNC that would need to be patched
You think the correct answer always is a patch? Wrong!
The first step is to figure out what you actually want. Then show you the existing configuration option (or e.g. a module) to do what you want. Then, if there's no such opiton, a patch, and not just on your side, but in upstream ZNC, so that it benefits everyone, not just you. Of course, if this is useful at all."

It *seems* like you want some kind of error message in your web browser. As you already heard, the error that you wanted to get is not possible, because the internet does not work that way. If you want an ""connection closed unexpectedly"" error message, you can just remove the call to `Write()` here:
https://github.com/znc/znc/blob/e0ffdddd473e97cb843f2bc8ad4fa16cf47c65b4/src/Listener.cpp#L149-L151
If you want another kind of error message, you can try replacing this with `Write(""this is definitely not http\n"");`. No idea how browsers react to that, but perhaps one of these two options solves the problem you are actually trying to solve.

I’ve been wanting to remove the `webadmin` module and fully disable ZNC from being able to respond anything meaningful over HTTP, because it listens to the same port as the IRC protocol one and so I cannot just block the port. Either this is a behaviour not achievable or I am missing a setting somewhere after searching the wiki for a solution.
I tried setting `AllowWeb` to `false` by hand on my only listener but it doesn’t work, as ZNC still serves an html page saying that `Web Access have is not enabled.`

I think that that gets to my underlying objection to adding any support for lxml. We are a Markdown parser. What harm is there in allowing third party extensions to inject a separate parser? Well, then we officially support it with all its edge cases. Now ever time some user runs into some obscure edge case with lxml, we need to deal with it. No thanks. I'm not interesting in the extra burden that the long term support will require.
Of course, this doesn't prevent you from accomplishing your end result. Just return a string from your parser which you then insert as a raw string into the Markdown output."

This is what we don't want to deal with. I don't really know what you are doing with lxml and at what stage in the process, but I imagine there are ways to do what you need to without lxml. I realize that lxml is a preferred option for you, but I can envision all sorts of issues if we went this route.
And this isn't really a completely abstracted approach as there may be non-etree like parsers out there that someone would want to use. This really would only work for etree-like parsers, particularly lxml. What if I wanted to use html5lib? I don't think this would work. You'd have to completely abstract the interface. But again, you'd still have quirks maybe.

I am involved in the [BeautifulSoup](https://launchpad.net/beautifulsoup) project as I provide the [CSS selector](https://github.com/facelessuser/soupsieve) library for that project. That project actually does create an abstract interface (for the purpose of extracting the content) around the built-in HTML lib, lxml, and html5lib, so I do know a little about this, and I don't appreciate the condescending tone. Let's try and keep this civil.

I understand that, but it may introduce issues into existing pieces we do maintain. But it also may not. The point is that the maintainer has selected an HTML parser, and is not currently interested in opening the door for more ""potential"" maintenance burden. It may not offer any issues currently, but it could in the future, and once we start supporting this, we are committed to handling related workarounds etc. that may be required in the future.

3802,978528716,978528716,None,"Regarding the [earlier pull request](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/pull/1177) I propose a _custom parser interface_ for better integration with third party projects using e.g. _lxml_.
### Purpose:
Help developers of third party projects to easily change the internal parser (etree) if their custom extensions do have need for extended functionality of e.g. _lxml_.
### Usage:
```python
import markdown
import lxml.etree
markdown.etree.set_parser(lxml.etree)
html = markdown.markdown(""# Hello extended XPath World"")

### Criticism:
Compatibility issues of third party parsers do not have to be targeted by Python-Markdown development team, as projects like _lxml.etree_ claim to be compatible with _xml.etree.ElementTree_

There should be no legal conflicts (BSD/MIT) in case of lxml. :-D

> The fact that e2e tests from Gutenberg can block PRs for wp-env look like a good thing to me, they're validating that wp-env changes work properly as well.
The test cases that run on this repository seem mainly Gutenberg-related. Which of the tests validate that `wp-env` is working correctly? Are those tests somehow tied to the Gutenberg code?
![screenshot of tests](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17307/130951178-370010bf-a76d-4f76-879b-583b160d464a.gif)
> all the documentation and instructions, would need to be rewritten.
I don't see much in the [@wordpress/env documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) that would seem to require rewriting. Is there some other source of documentation I am missing? For example, perhaps some parts [managing packages](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages#managing-packages) document would need to be included in a separate `wp-env` repository to aid in the publication workflow?
> the package itself gathers a community on its own, pursuing higher goals (e.g. a general-purpose local environment like you mentioned), warranting separate forums, documentation, etc.
I also agree with this framing. However, having a separate repository doesn't imply different forums or sweeping changes to the documentation, as suggested.
> The same arguments here about running tests and finding issues could be made for other packages, not just @wordpress/env. And they are not un-solvable tasks.
I agree the `[Package] Env` label is useful and observe the resourcefulness of Gutenberg's core engineering team. However, is it possible to exclude some of the Gutenberg tests from running on commits to the `wp-env` package? I.e., improve the signal/noise ratio of the CI workflow.
> A separate repo would require building new workflows
What are some new workflows that would be needed? Relatedly, what are some existing workflows that might require modification?
> WordPress/gutenberg is the de facto monorepo for all WordPress JavaScript packages (replacing WordPress/packages, if you remember that one). There are indeed benefits to keeping all these things in one place, from contributor onboarding to maintenance to publishing.
Thanks for the clarification about the onboarding, maintenance, and publishing. What would be some maintenance and onboarding costs of maintaining the `wp-env` project in a separate repository? Conversely, what might be some benefits or improvements of having independent projects?
> Gutenberg repository attract a lot more people and expose them to the @wordpress/env, a separate repository would probably not. It's a great side effect that WordPress (PHP) developers appreciate the work by Gutenberg developers on a local environment
I'm concerned with relevancy and clarity. For example, when I came to this repository to change the `wp-env` code and documentation, I had difficulty finding the code in the `packages` folder among various other packages. While the Gutenberg project is a remarkable undertaking, most of the code, commit history, CI pipeline, and issues are just not salient to `wp-env` development.
> I'm also of the opinion that all WP npm packages should just be in this repository.
In addition to WP npm and Gutenberg packages, the `packages` folder also includes tests (`e2e-*`) a lot of third-party code (like `react-*`, `jest-*`, `babel-*`, `eslint`, `*-webpack-*`, `redux-*`, `docgen` and `is-shallow-equal`). There are likely pragmatic reasons for keeping development dependencies under revision control instead of `package.json`, but it adds further weight to the codebase and commit-history. Repository ""clutter"" is particularly undesirable when wanting to contribute to a specific environment tool (`wp-env`) that decoupled from both Gutenberg and WordPress core."

I've been trying to use `wp-env` and `wp-scripts` as a core development packages for plugin development instead of rolling my own local development setup.

> The most obvious thing is ""dog-fooding"" which, back in the day, the WordPress community actually embraced, but is not doing here. All of these packages should be separate and consumed as a user (theme and plugin developer) would.
That's a fairly blanket statement that I'd like to provide a counterpoint from observation. I'm aware of _numerous_ plugins and themes that utilize the packages as they are currently distributed. Just a few at the top of my mind at the moment: WooCommerce, WooCommerce Blocks, Calypso, Jetpack, Yoast SEO, Event Espresso. The fact that the Gutenberg project isn't directly pulling these packages from NPM isn't something I'd consider a hindrance. In fact, the opposite is true, I think it allows the project to react more quickly to issues (for reasons others have already pointed out in this thread) that are reported by plugin and theme authors using the packages.
Historically, WordPress has always been a monorepo in some way as far as dev tooling goes (PHPUnit tests, JS test suites, Grunt build tool, the [entire ""develop"" WP structure](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop) is a testament to that). > But, on the second part, Gutenberg's release constraints already slow down the release of fixes to the developer packages.
I think there's some truth in this observation but more related to the delay in package updates when in the midst of a WordPress release cycle. This is already a known thing and something that will be iterated on. Outside of the WordPress release cycle, it's been my experience that the package updates are generally pretty frequent.
On the other hand, there are many efficiencies that are gained from working in a mono repo (through experience in trying both approaches) that effectively means momentum is kept in improving the packages. Efficiencies that would be lost in splitting everything out to its own repository.

I wonder if it'd be worthwhile to capture as a list the problems/friction contributing/consuming packages in the Gutenberg repo both to outline the tradeoffs being made currently and acknowledge that for some users this is a hindrance to making contributions.

From what I've seen the reason is exactly the opposite of your cases on why `wp-env` should stay in this mono repo, keeping Gutenberg separate means that it can be developed faster than WordPress Core releases. Which also allows people to install this plugin which overrides the Gutenberg that is included in WordPress Core."

I for one would actually love for Gutenberg and core to merge into a single mono repository. The reason it's not is that we don't want to lose all the github flavor and tooling that comes with it. Merging Gutenberg and Core doesn't prevent Gutenberg to ship a plugin (or an alpha version of WordPress) faster than Core, we're just dealing with the difficulty to more Core to GitHub or similar."

For example, it was mentioned that managing issues is difficult. If there are motivated contributors, then using a project board or tracking issue are effective ways to manage a project.

Since Gutenberg is a complex WordPress plugin, it relies heavily on the underlying WordPress environment. If the underlying WordPress environment breaks through a change in `wp-env`, tests in Gutenberg will fail. So you could consider each Gutenberg test also a test of `wp-env`. Gutenberg tests related to file uploads also test that the `wp-env` file system works with file uploads, for example. It's important for us to not make a change to `wp-env` which would cause a plugin to stop working with it. The Gutenberg test suite has the side effect of testing that. We know that `wp-env` works well in CI because it is working great in the Gutenberg CI suite.
Additionally, the lint checks will lint wp-env code, and the unit tests will run the wp-env unit tests. So `wp-env` gets a significant amount of test coverage ""by accident,"" just because the wp-env code is used in CI and part of the monorepo!
I do think there are monorepo solutions to many of the other problems:
- Build times. Interestingly, `wp-env` doesn't have any build step. If you execute `./packages/env/bin/wp-env`, it will run the local files directly in node, no build step. So I think local development is extremely easy for that reason.
- Dependencies. Yarn has a thing called focus workspaces, where only dependencies related to the package you want to develop are installed. I think `npm` has, in newer versions, a similar feature, so in theory that will help solve that problem.
- CI taking a long time. I don't think this is just a wp-env problem! Certainly everyone would love for CI to be blazing fast in Gutenberg :)
I also wonder if the issue with how quickly contributions are accepted is more related to the number of people maintaining `wp-env`? I don't have the time to focus on wp-env any more, and I often become a bottleneck when no one else is looking at new PRs to wp-env."

#### Summary
This feature is EXTREMELY basic and the whole doctrine ORM is basically useless if you are unable to convert entities (select query results, etc) into json for returning in an API. Either the feature doesn't exist, which is honestly unbelievable, or there is a desperate need to add documentation for it, since not even stackoverflow requests have come to any reasonable conclusion in the past 10 years."

this is a Quality Assurance Write-up Complaint about everything bad, unintuitive, convoluted, and otherwise
in need of serious QA (Quality Assurance) love. Retroarch NEEDS to up their QA to be able to act as a platform
for emulators. This post is meant to be intentionally hyper-critical and nitpicky on first world problems, because the experience is just that annoying. I hope to point out to readers many problems with the readability of Retroarch, and it's common user experience. I also hope if taken seriously, i get a contributor interested enough by my points, to add me and talk to me on discord, so we can work together on bringing retroarch up to a level people expect it to be at, and help retroarch hit console or platform level quality it is so desperately missing.
==================Chapter 0: I Didn't Even Launch It Yet And I Have Complaints=================
Note: If you are only contributor level and not developer level, scroll down and skip to chapter 1.
I'm going to start by looking at retroarchs website and steam page, and boy, before we even launch retroarch
for the first time, there a lot to talk about already. Infact, to even do this write up, or rather to attempt to
talk about it on the issues section on github i was pointed to, it says this is for bug reports only.
Currently, i'm under the assumption i'm already somehow breaking the rules by doing what i was told.
Not a good start, but not the worst. With that out of the way that i'm posting here on request, and not out
of ignorance for the warning github gives new posts, lets move on.
Lets look at the Website and steam page front pages. I kind of want to talk about them both at once.
I'll start with the opening description on both. It's to technical. Retroarch as i see it, is looking to be
a platform, like steam, to access things. Like the playstation XMB, or switch home screen. For a description,
on the site we get ""RetroArch is a frontend for emulators, game engines and media players."" and on steam ""RetroArch is an open source and cross platform frontend/framework for emulators, game engines, video games, media players and other applications""
This actually tells a user very little about what retro arch is, and isn't. Even people emulator savvy won't
understand the rest of what is being thrown at them. a 'frontend' for emulators? lets google frontend. ""frontend can refer to any hardware that optimizes or protects network traffic."" People aren't playing these
online, or it's not their first thought. They don't need protection from the net when playing mario. Okay,
maybe a smart person will think it has multiple definitions, and google more accurately. lets google Frontend Program
""A Front End developer (dev) works with designers and Back End devs to create a website"" Well, retroarch
isn't a website (Well technically it is but you know what i mean), it's a program itself. Already, using the
term frontend is to much. If you want retroarch to really succeed, to shine, you need to make it marketable and understandable. The optics matter, if people don't know what it is, they won't know why they should care
about being interested in it. when people say it's convoluted, you shouldn't need an 30 minutes of research
to even understand your opening sentences.
it also says 'game engines, and media players'. Why? Lets be honest, retroarch runs emulators. Thats what it
does. Why do you need to complicate this? Does it run other things sure, but nobody is seriously wanting it as their number 1 music player or picture taker. why can't you speak english? the steam page says emulators,
so someone knew that word, why aren't these two sources on the same page for their advertising? Unfortunately
the steam page then says game engines, video games, media players, and other apps.
What fucking goon is downloading retroarch just to play music. This is not a good use of advertising space.
The human being looking at your steam page can see the music menu in your advertising images. Use your text
space better, seriously!!! Why is this so hard! Also, it says emulators, then game engines, then video games.
pick ONE! these are all synonyms in practicality. People also don't need to know it's open source
in your intro, you can say that later. From what i've later come to understand, the devs want to use the term 'Core'. They want this because they believe in what retroarch does aside from emulators. Sure, except...the opening advertisement doesn't say 'Core'. Here is a good opener. ""RetroArch is a all in one platorm for Emulation that enhances the games you play
and other Cores. From retro era to modern games, you can even play online with friends!"" This is a fantastic, easy to digest, explanatory, to the point advertisement that tells people what
retroarch is, what it DOES (Enhances emulator games), and avoid words like ""nintendo"" or ""platstation"" for
copywrite while still getting the ""old to current"" idea across. Make your text readable to people! If they want more
they can hit up a FAQ. Note: Going forward, i will be referring to a reasonable way to read something, or
a problem with text that is to jargin-driven as ""Readability"" as a unbrella term. This will come up A LOT
and will be a serious problem with retroarch in nearly every part of anyones experience. Please remember this.
Lets move on. in the websites next section, it says you can run original game discs, but steam says the feature isn't out yet. These are literally giving conflicting information. Seriously? ITS YOUR FRONT PAGE!
Next, lets look at some visuals here. For the website, i want to look at the ""A polished Interface"" Slide.
This makes it look like playstation, cool. Except this isn't what it looks like in retroarch by default.
Make it clear in advertising this is a skin. Also, ironically, the interface is excessively NOT polished, but
i will be getting to that as a major complaint in another chapter. But right now, it's a skin, say it's
a skin. The very idea their not saying its not the default skin here, implies someone knew it was terrible and
tried to hide it. Maybe ask why they needed to hide your real interface? We will get to that later...
Moving back to steam, lets look at the slides/image roll. First is the trailers. All three are really fucking bad.
Trailer 1: its a fun logo (sure, fine) then shows the menu with garbage readability that makes a person
want to flee just looking at it, followed by showing what has GOT to be one of the WORST POSSIBLE game examples.
like, you CANNOT be serious. the website slides show mario, and this trailer has a level ID called zero / megaman129. Show us a actual video game. Make the trailer show like 8+ games of different genres. Make it CLEAR that retroarch plays VIDEO GAMES, and not, whatever the fuck that is. Bad advertising affects
end user readability to understand what retroarch is and is not. and this is contributing to why you get topics
saying people are confused about retroarch.
Trailer 2: Literally a logo. Why is this here? Remove it.
Trailer 3: This feels like a meme. Seriously, this is cruel, it hurts. It's like someone took what makes a good intro video and butchered it to the max. No BGM, no person explaining things, no examples
of games being played, it's super fast (Epilepsy educing even?). So fast you can't even read all the text
without pausing the video. Please make a real trailer. Look at like, any nintendo direct. Do that, but for retroarch. Show off and explain lots. I'll help QA it if you need someone. We can improve this.
Then the steam slides, their mostly the exact same menu. Why? Why not Show off various parts of retroarch? Actually make people interested. Your telling me you create all of retroarch, and the only part
you want people to know about is 2 screens? wtf? Now i can go on, but the pre-retroarch experience is getting comically long at this point.
I'll move onto actual retroarch, but rest assured, i can REALLY go on about whats wrong before even downloading.
In summary
1: Very poor readability
2: Poor advertising
3: Bad use of space
4: inconsistent between steam and website
5: Doesn't actually say what retroarch does in words people can understand let alone google. ===============Chapter 1: ""A Polished Interface""? Actually It's Really Fucking Garbage======================
Note: I have gotten some responses to points in this chapter from users using custom alternate skins for
RetroArch that change how the menu actually functions and displays information, and not just the visuals.
This chapter is about a first time experience, and as such uses the default skin. Before i actually talk about the REAL first impression, i want to point out i downloaded website and steam
both, to check for differences. Guess what? The first impression is diffrent. Inconsistent again? Ugh.
From website, it launched windowed, and you lack the cool cursor, and get the ultra low quality windows
menu that feels like a 2005 program with file/command/windows despite that retroarch has it's own in-app menus.
This doesn't happen on steam, it launches in fullscreen on first boot. The difference here is very important.
Not everyone knows you can Alt+Enter programs to fullscreen them. Infact, this is semi-rare info. This is made worst by F11 being the windows default to fullscreen, but boy do i wish complaining ended here.
If a non-steam user tries to fullscreen by hitting F11, retroarch hotkeys this to swapping between the windows
and custom cursor. Now, the custom one looks good, but it locks you into the windows. Surely you can
make your cursor not get locked, come on. But even worse, is when someone wants out and presses F11 again. I CANNOT BELIEVE how bad this is. If you are multi-monitor, your cursor is now locked to the monitor
retroach was in itself, untill you move retroarch. Clickin on it, pressing hotkeys ect won't fix this.
I don't mean using the retro cursor, i mean normal windows cursor, you can't leave your moniter. what the actual fuck? what a joke! I haven't even talked about retroarch contents directly, and
i can barely type up this QA review because retroarch literally won't let my cursor go click on notepad. >:(
it gets worse. If your fullscreen and press F11, your cursor doesn't change, but your mouse still can't
leave the moniter. The user would have no idea why and think retroarch is just a bad program. How can
you have this many errors and i'm not even talking about retroarch itself yet?????
OKAY, actual retroarch time. You can argue before this, thats a unintended bug, sure. Lets looks at whats NOT a bug.
So, we boot into the main menu that is...lacking readability at best. ""Load Core""? Why? these things are called emulators, call them emulators. ""Load Emulator"" is perfectly reasonable English. It's my understanding the devs want the term
Cores because it also uses something called Cores in addition to emulaitors. Sure, but you want to be
a marketable, understandable program? speak in words people actually understand. it's my understanding the team personally wants 'Load Core / Content' as they want to do more then emulators. In counter to this, i have 2 suggestions. Either split the menu AND load between Emulators (Load Emulaitor / Game), and other Cores (Load Core / Content), or make the load
button hidden untill a emulaitor or core is ready, then have it show Load Game or Load Content based on what Emu/Core
is loaded! Easy! Also, this menu is bloated.
So, 1: Split the cores menu, between ""Cores"", and a new one called ""Emulators""
2-1: In addition to Load Content, add a new menu called Load Game right under Emulators.
2-2: Or, make load content/game hidden until a emulator or core is loaded in already.
3: Also change Esc defaulting to exiting the program, to a back button. This is semi-common, and straight up default
in nearly every PC game. If your a platform on a PC for people gaming on a PC, use a PC control scheme. wtf?
there is a quit button if needed, and Alt+F4 or Alt+Enter, we don't need to troll PC users with a comically
bad default control scheme thats normally a menu button on almost every pc video game ever released.
""Bloated"" i'm going to define, as to many things being in one menu, or things being in the wrong location.
Here, we have the main menu showing config, info, and help. But we have a left side bar. whats the difference between config and settings? this is already a readability problem, they can be seen as synonyms. Now, i'm gonna be going all over unfocused here, because there is so many problems their all interwoven.
The Config file menu, why is this a menu? 1: Delete the Config menu entry
2: Move the contents of the config menu, to the top of the settings menu. 3: Why is help a menu with only 1 content? Literally delete this menu.
4: Move Menu Controls and it's icon to the bottom left of retroarch below the white line. This menu is first of all stupid and should probably be removed entirely, however...
4-2: Rename Menu Controls to Controller and have this lead directly to the input menu. If you really want,
include the Menu controls in Controller, but really it's common sense, and people can customize this,
so the stated controls in Menu Controls can literally lie to the user, this is dumb.
5-1: on first startup, maybe do a first time setup that asks the user what menu icons they would like.
let them pick from switch, xbox, playstation, ect. Its also kinda bad to display Switch by default, but
use american playstation input scheme, and not having a switches A button actually be A. Readability issues!!!!!
5-2: If that is a copywrite problem, alternatively let people customize the on-screen symbols with letters. In this way,
people can recreate their console of choice setup while working around looking like it clones a competitor, because
it's a customization option of a user. And don't tell me customization options aren't fair game when your straight up
stealing the playstation home menu theme >_>
Now that thats done, we have a nice (enough) looking home. Onward to settings. The entire thing is bloated. There is also a lot of 2-menus required trolls. There are so many times you look in one menu and need to google to find another menu, it's not even funny. 1: First up, just like the white line at the bottom of retroarch, i recommend a new break line in the middle
of settings. Things below it will be advanced settings, and title the section Advanced. Alternatively, if
this won't translate well to alternate skins, instead have a menu in here called Advanced at the bottom of settings.
Rename Saving to Saving Games (Readability, this seems like save Retroarch settings when it's here like this!)
2: Throw logging, File Browser, On-Screen Display, AI Service, Latency, into Advanced.
3: Delete the entire power management menu. wtf is this? It's literally empty. LITERALLY, USELESS. WHO????
4: Rename Network to Online, or Online Multiplayer. (Readability!)
5: Rename Input to Controllers
6-1: On the left bar, Rename Import Content to ""Create Playlist"" (Because that is literally what it does)
6-2: Move the playlists menu into the now named ""Create Playlist"" menu, de-bloat settings, so only people who care about the playlist menus are forced to see and scroll past this option. 6-3: Add a button named ""More Information on Playlists"" or maybe ""Playlists Tutorial"" or similar as well
to explain what is a 'Playlist', how to set them up, needing cores/emulators, ect.
6-4: if a Scan to create a playlist in a directory comes up empty, have a pop up explaining why. (Missing cores, ect)
7: I cannot believe you have a menu called configuration here, when i earlier talked about configuration in
the main menu. Why do you have 2 config menus, and a settings menu? HELLO? This is so troll, the
config options in settings/config effect your stuff in main menu/config. Why the fuck are they not together?
Who designed this? *Phew* now that thats done.....
7-1: In this submenu, move 'Use Global Core Options File' to the 'Load Core' Menu we are renaming to 'Load Emulator'.
7-2: We are also renaming this option ""Use Global Emulator Options"".
Readability is very important! 7-3: Finally, If (hopefully) Main menu config is moving to settings, either delete this Configuration menu, and move its only remaining option (Save Config on Quit) to settings, or move the config stuff from main menu, inside this config sub-menu. 8: AGAIN with the 2 menus needed trolls. Inside Directory we have a lot of playlist stuff, why?
8-1: In playlist menu (that we are moving to the menu in point 6 we are calling ""Create Playlist"" Menu) create a new menu called Playlist Directories
8-2: Move everything playlist related from settings/Directory to Music/Playlist Directories. This is to de-bloat menus with unnecessary information overflow, and put settings in menus they are actually
used in, like any other emulaitor (PCSX2/RPCS3/Citra/Cemu/Yuzu/ect)
9: Speaking of multiple same named menus, we have achievements, and a users achievements. STOP DOING THIS!!!!
why do you want people to need to google one menu doesn't work without the other menu! THIS IS SO TROLL, STOP IT!
9-1: Rename User to Account Settings & Achievements
9-2: Move the achievements menu into this newly named menu to de-bloat settings, and put this in a reasonable spot.
9-3: The Accessibility menu only has 1 option in it. Stop having troll 1 option menus. Delete this menu
9-4: Rename the Sub-menu ""Accessibility Enable"" To ""Text to Speech""
9-5: Move ""Text to Speech"" to the Account Settings & Achievements, so one user can use it, and
another different user doesn't have to deal with troll text to speech in their ears. 10: Continuing from 9, we have streaming options in account, and them in recording. WHY.
10-1: Rename ""Recording"" to ""Recording & Live Streams""
10-2: move the the content of the now ""Account Settings & Achievements"" / Account / Retroachievements to
the Achievements menu that was moved here in part 9. 10-3: The Youtube/Twitch/Facebook Gaming sub-menus only have 1 content, STOOOP FUCKINGGG DOOOING THIIIIS. >:((((
we are deleteing these sub-menus. 10-3: Move the menus inside the Youtube/Twitch/Facebook Gaming sub-menu stream key options from here, to the now named ""Recording & Live Streams"" menu. 10-4: in the ""Recording & Live Streams"" menu/Streaming Quality, give one of those grey sub-descriptions.
Something like ""Suitable for 720P Streams"" ""For 1080P Streams"" Ect. 10-5: Also rename the menu to Stream Quality.
Oh boy, onto input (that we said we are renaming to Controller)
11-1: Move Maximum Users to...somewhere. Wtf even is this menu? If this actually means users, move it to the
relevant online menu. If it means locally, rename this to ""Maximum Controllers"". 11-2: If the later, Create one of those Advanced Options line breaks again at the bottom, and move this
down there, along with every other option in this menu untill we get to Menu Controls. 11-3: MENU CONTROLLS? HELLO? Why does main menu get help on menu controlls, BUT WE HAVE A ACTUAL MENU CONTROLS MENU? PUT RELEVANT MENUS IN RELEVANT PLACES THANK YOU.
11-4: Move the Automatic Mouse Grab option to the Video menu in Settings. This is something usually in that
menu on other programs, stop being unintuitive!!! How can you make so many mistakes!!!
Speaking of the Video menu, lets tackle that next.
12-1:in Fullscreen Mode, rename Windowed Fullscreen to ""Borderless Fullscreen"" or just ""Borderless"",
and change the description appropriately.
12-2: Rename Fullscreen Width & Height to ""Custom Width"" (& Height). It's already in the fullscreen sub-menu, you don't need to remind them what menu they are in, it's at the top of the screen!
12-3: Move CRTSwitchRes and Output below the Fullscreen and Windowed sub-menus. Order matters! Most important
things go on top!
I can keep going, but i'll stop here. This is a Serious Checklist of Readability improvements across the entire settings menu. However, if i reconsider, i may suggest adding Controller to the left bar as a major
menu instead, as it's reasonab;y so important, it should be a major menu, rather then some garbage like Music.
=====================Chater 2: A Smoothe Gameplay Experience? Or A Troubleshooting Nightmare?=====================
Before i get into further details on games, i strongly recommend a new setting somewhere, on by default, that
makes it so when you load a game, and pick a emulaitor (Remember, we are calling these Games and Emulaitors, NOT
Cores and Content) that it associates that game to that emulaitor by default. In the future, you should be
able to Load game -> Pick the game -> it just boots up without needing to pick a emulaitor. I...HOPE i don't have to explain how bad it is that steam retroarch is missing a download button. I will skip
over the easy wall of text on this and move forward.
1: For steam users, there should still be a download emulaitor button, but as a submenu. 1-1: In here, There should be a link to your website with a list of emulaitors to download.
1-2: There should be a setting here, or in the Install Emulaitor menus to set the directory for cores.
This is because this options is only useful & relevant right at this moment, and never again, so it
does not need to be in the directroies menu elsewhere.
2: When in-game, move the Command/Menu button to the top of the list. I also feel a menu rename is in order, but can't think of one right now, and want to move on.
3-1: Add save state and load state to the Command menu. Yes i know they are in the F1 menu. Make them accessable.
3-2: In the F1 menu, move State slot below load state
And oh boy, lets get into the F1 menu. In no particular order...
4-0: Make it WAY more obvious to assign a button or combo to open this menu from controller.
probably include it in the quick menu directly at the bottom, even if the option exists somewhere else,
just duplicate it. 4-00: Also, Escape should open the quick menu by default
4-1: Originally i said Rename Information to Game Information, but i forgot i was still allowing for cores/content menus before.
i now suggest making this menus name be contextual, based on if a emulator, or core is loaded. This way people only using
emulators can have it reasonably say 'Game Information' and those who use cores still get 'Information' so it
doesn't clash with any development team desires.
4-2: Move the Controller menu to right below Close Content
4-3: Also rename that to Close Game
4-4: Adding something to favorites and you can't remove it? WHY? Make this menu change to Remove from Favorites if it's a favorite >_>
4-5: Remove the descriptions for Resume, Restart, and Close game. This screen has lots the player wants
to see and not enough screen space even when in fullscreen. 4-6: Also remove descriptions on save state, load state, Take Screenshot, Cheats, Achievements, and Rewind.
4-7: (Someone gave a good point against this, nevermind)
4-8: Make it so if the player presses cancel in the F1 to go to Main Menu, Then cancel again, it resumes the game.
4-9: move Show Desktop Menu from Main Menu while ingame to somewhere else (Probably settings).
With that out of the way, once ingame, there is no menu option to go back!
Add a button in windowed mode to open back the retroarch menu. If you tell me it's a hotkey, i don't care.
thats not intuitive! Make a button to go back to the retroarch menu!!!
Finally, this SHOULD be obvious, but it's not, so i will say it here.
I assume this is a major feature, but really, let people access that emulaitors settings when using it.
if we can't do that, retroarch is just worse then every emulaitor, because they have settings you NEED to even
run some games. If this option DOES exist, it's EXTREMELY hidden!
Moving on, post gameplay, your recent games don't show up in load content / load game.
Why isn't there a recent games list? And why can't you set a content / game directory in directories? If you can, that option should 100% be in the load content / Load Game menu, as this is where
it's actually relevant!!!
=======================Ending==================
I'll stop here, it's been 3 hours of complaints, but retroarch is riddles with terrible quality.
Why would anyone want to use this? 1: An unfun troubleshooting experience in exchange for playing games in the worst quality possible without access to emulators settings. 2: Some games are literally unplayable in retroarch because you can't access emu settings
3: The menus are bloated, and lie / decieves / give half truths by hiding relevant other options in other menus
for no other reason then to troll you. The overall feeling is Retroarch is giving you the run-around, asking you
to do something in some menu you don't know where it is, and when you find it, wants another setting in
another menu you don't know where it is. 4: it's a pain to setup even for simple emulators
5: you can't even understand what retroarch is or isn't from inconsistent and contradictory messages,
to near moon-rune levels of advertising.
6: unintuitive menus and lacking default settings mean you need to go over everything before even attempting
to test a single title.
7: Using it via steam is a whole extra nightmare that could be made easy if anyone actually fucking cared.
It's easy to see why people don't recommend recroarch. The real question is if anyone is going to actually
do anything about it, or delete this post / no reply / no one for me to directly work with in a timely fashon /
stick their head in the clouds and ignore why people don't enjoy their product. My discord is Dawnbomb#3408, and i'm open to any actual developer contacting me and working hand in hand for
some actual quality assurance before the steam deck launches, but considering how obvious, easy, and
near intensionally-troll the levels of design are here, i expect no contact and noone willing to work to make
retroarch not be complete fucking bullshit bloatware on a PC, and i only scratched the surface of this QA nightmare.
====================Chapter 3: Extra add-ons i thought of later=========================
Note: Some of the things here delve closer to more serious changes to retroarchs codeing.
Still, their good changes.
1: Controller backround input should be in the input (Hopefully named Controller) Menu, not in another menu (User Interface).
Setting up controller input in your controllers, then having if the actual input happens be decided in a separate menu, is another weird location problem.
2: While im at it, Turbo Fire should be a setting INSIDE a controllers port controls. This would allow each controller to have separate turbo settings per player. 3: Altho highly unusual, some players enjoy playing games with two people one controller mode. Some people even go so far as to speedrun like this. Allowing multiple controllers assign buttons to the same button on the same port of a input would go a long way in support for those people."

3864,1004915962,930204616,None,"The official release 2021b of TZDB contains changes that would negatively affect Joda-Time users. If adopted it would be impossible to hold identifiers such as `Europe/Bratislava`, `Europe/Zagreb` and `America/Guadeloupe` (and many others) in memory. Any attempt to do so would see the ID replaced by another one.
Separately, the official 2021b release of TZDB has also effectively removed the timezone history of 9 zone IDs including `Africa/Accra` (Ghana) and `America/Nassau` (The Bahamas). This would see any queries for time-zone offsets pre-1970 return a different value."

3868,1004915962,1216384100,None,Release v2.11.0 also uses global-tz. Closing this as we now have a strategy going forward.

1. As previously stated, we do not support pytest so any reports about it not working will be ignored.
2. We are not able to reproduce the report that tox is not running correctly. Presumably, we would need more information about the environment to replicate the issue.
> Additional Q: How to build module documentation as man page?
I'm not sure if you are referring to the CLI or the `docs/` directory. For the CLI, we are using `optparse` from the Python Standard Library. There should be various existing third-party tools which will convert the output of `optparse`'s `--help` to man page(s). I would suggest exploring those options. We currently use MkDocs to render the content of the `docs/` directory to HTML. Last I knew, no-one has made a MkDocs plugin which outputs man pages and I could care less about doing so."
3872,1011467346,999940954,Irony,"> You seem to be running the tests with pytest which is not supported
I want only to add that running test suite in fixed env has some value however it is some other value to run test suite in opened set of modules if pytest is uses because power of that framework comes from extension which can alter testing process without single touch tested tree.
I'm not asking to switch CI to pytest however I think that alter test framework to be able tun pytest in some minimal env may have some added value.
Looks like it is issue with only with tests/test_syntax/extensions/test_md_in_html.py.
As long as that is added to ignore list pytest Work™️.

In other words to make whole tree pytest ready it does not look that is that much to do .."
3873,1011467346,999944718,Bitter frustration,"I can understand the desire to use a specific testing framework, but that choice is chosen by the maintainer and must be respected.
If there was a specific advantage for us to move over to pytest, we could have that conversation, but I realize, as you mentioned, that is not the conversation we are currently having.
If we were to add py.test support just so others could use it, then we have to maintain it and ensure it doesn't break or we are going to get issues to ""fix pytest"" on occasions when it breaks inadvertently. Since this project is not using any features from pytest, it makes no sense for us to go out of our way, even if it is only slightly out of the way, to accommodate pytest.
I have nothing against pytest and use it in a number of my projects, but this project's maintainer has chosen not to use it. I can see no upside for us to fix pytest support as we have no intention of monitoring ensuring that it does not break."

Since this project is not using any features from pytest, it makes no sense for us to go out of our way, even if it is only slightly out of the way, to accommodate pytest.
Adding correctly working pytest support is VERY important.
That importance is not only about exact tested module. Just please add to testing picture fact that in exact test suite is adding yet another workload to all modules involved in testing. In other words it is about health of whole ecosystem (in this case python ecosystem).
Additionally .. I 'm finishing now some packages build automation to be able to run kind of set f scratch build if build systems are not bus. In case of python it address some random set of additional pytest extension and perform build with logging results .. only. In such cases if for example if lets say will be added `pytest-randomly` it would be possible to prove that random reshuffling units may cause that test suite fail it will mean that internally test suite have some dependencies between units and even if all test suite executed without `randomly` extension running exact unit by `pytest <some/file.py>::<some_unit>` will definitely fail. Sometimes test suites are running quite long time or on implementing new unit such way of running isolated units may be useful.
I want only to say that as long that `markdown` test suite will be not working I would not be able to do that or in this exact case I would be doing that only with part of the test suite.
Form that point of view I'm asking to to fix test suite or something like that.
As I have now `markdown` in set of my distro packages I'll be to perform such new way of testing your module.
In other words I want only to encourage to prepare some base line id you want to have such testing completely for free (that automation will be only flagging some found issue without single second spend by you :) )
If you don't care about that is 100%/perfectly fine :)
If you care .. just please have look closer on the code which you know because cost of that fix may be really low :)
I'm specialist on packaging area so form me fixing that seems is a bit to high :P (I've stumped on python modules only ~10 months ago so I'm still learning however after finishing +700 modules as rpm/Solaris IPS packages I see some patters which I can exploit giving back to the community results of my work).
Cheers :)"

I understand you have a vision and you have a desire to collect testing data, but I'm going to be very blunt about this, if your whole system depends on every python package you use to support your specific testing framework, you are building a very fragile system. Cornering other projects into using one specific testing framework is not a good idea, and it takes away the freedom of that project to maintain their project in a way that they find most suitable to them.
What if some other framework comes out that a project finds more enticing than pytest? Are they not allowed to take advantage of that testing framework as to not break your pytest dependent system?
I'm not seeing an advantage for us to switch to pytest, and I definitely can't see a reason to set up and test an additional framework that will test the exact same tests.
Again, I have nothing against pytest, and I do use it myself. There are features pytest has that make testing easier in some cases, but this project doesn't currently have a scenario that we **need** anything beyond what is already offered by Python's unittest module."
3876,1011467346,1000007082,Entitlement,"> if your whole system depends on every python package you use to support your specific testing framework
Indeed .. issue is that I want to know before those areas of sensitivity before my client will come to me and will tell me ""here it is something wrong"" :)
In other words it is kind of proactive approach.
What will happen next is completely independent an probably would require some assessment about what to do with that.
Running few POCs I found some interesting results. What could be done next with those results is matter of running that framework on larger scale to be able identify some patterns and maybe design some other automation on top of that.
Going back to the ticket subject. Really please have look one more time on that case because it may be something very easy to fix for you .. only this and nothing more :P
Please .."

3936,1027933041,944898938,None,"Is your request something like this?
* Invent some special metadata that can be set on a Flatpak (or Snap?) app, with the semantics ""this app can take screenshots without prompting"". Flatpak (and Snap?) would not do anything differently in setting up sandboxes based on this metadata, it's just a marker.
* Make the screenshot portal look for that metadata in `/.flatpak-info`. If it's present, just take the screenshot without prompting, with parameters (window/whole screen/etc.) controlled by the request.
* Maybe the portal backend is still responsible for visual/audio feedback (screen flash/shutter sound) to make sure the user is aware that a screenshot was taken?
* Ideally, app stores like Flathub limit access to that metadata (more review required), in the same way they ideally would for other ""dangerous"" permissions like `host` filesystem access.
Or a possible alternative would be to do something a bit like #638:
* Have a flag that the screenshot app can set, to say ""I'm always going to need this permission""
* The first time that flag is used, have a prompt with some sort of ""remember this"" option
* Make a note in the permission store that this app is OK to take screenshots any time, or give it a token that can be looked up in the permission store later, or similar
Or a mixture of the two: ignore or reject the flag from the second approach if it's set by an app that doesn't have the permission metadata from the first?"

Agree with this one. The user experience with pop up dialogs that require additional clicks every time you take a screenshot is just not a way to go.

We just don't want the application to be able to give itself this permission, or to be able to force the user to grant this permission in order to use it just once.

Honestly, your expectations are misplaced. Bypassing the screenshot portal is unacceptable, as it defeats the point of having the portal in the first place. Applications should not be able to screenshot your desktop without your permission. Removing the backdoor should not be controversial.

Yeah I fully agree!!
I understand the security concerns from the Gnome team, but it's also about giving users options. Give users the ability to give certain applications permission to do this and remember their choice.
Certain programs like Screenshot apps and screen capture/recording programs need this to work. And giving those programs permission every time gets tiring and not user friendly. (from an UX point of view)"

When a security feature is very annoying or even breaks software, it becomes an anti-feature. For example, when Telegram Desktop was failing to read files I was drag and dropping into it because the portal wasn't smart enough to see that drag and drop should give permissions for that file, I installed Flatseal and gave Telegram Desktop permissions to all files. Where's the security in that?
Any security features that are sufficiently irritating become just yet another annoying thing to turn off. They not only provide zero security, but are also an added annoyance.
While I appreciate the concern and I also appreciate that a decision was reached to implement the ""remember this obvious choice"" feature, I am disappointed that usability and actual security are not priorities and they are just an afterthought after users complain.
I would hope this is implemented and more care is taken in the future when ""security"" features are implemented, because for now I've gotten used to avoid Flatpaks in order to have actually functioning applications, and I'd love for that to change in the future."

I'm currently capturing bbox regions from 4k desktop (for performance reasons). Is screencast portal able to provide casts from partial desktop regions? Have to start searching for API documentation.

If you want GNOME 43 sooner, you can upgrade to Ubuntu 22.10 now or newer versions when they're released. None of these will be considered LTS releases though and non-LTS releases have a shorter support period of 9 months. This means you'll need to upgrade more frequently to stay on a supported version.
Another option is to install GNOME 43 from a third-party repository (like a PPA) or build it from source. This method can be risky, as it might cause compatibility issues or system instability.

This is Khanh, the creator of PowerDNS-Admin.
Sorry for being away for a long time. I would like to create this ""issue"" to update you on my current contribution status for PDA.
As I am not using PowerDNS anymore and have a new job, I have very little time that I can spend maintaining PowerDNS-Admin. However, I know there are still a lot of people who are using it and want to keep this project alive. So, I am looking for new maintainers for PowerDNS-Admin. If you are using it and interested in maintaining an open-source project, feel free to reach out to me at k[at]ndk.name. I am also thinking of transferring the project to an organization when it gets more maintainers.
There are still a lot of Pull Requests from you that need to be reviewed and merged. I will try to clear them this weekend.
Best,
Khanh"

Performed Tasks:
- Add H1 header
- `Read this ...` right alignmements
- Split a bit first paragraph to highlight welcome.
- Introduce Pull Request acronym.
- Trademark typos: GitHub, YouTube, Pull Request
- Update GitHub links urls. `help`/`guides` subdomain was moved to `docs` so a 301 Redirect is skipped.
- Details block added, with center align. When clicked, the contributor graphs are toggled.
- Some bolds to highlight common issues (like in CONTRIBUTING)
- Repo name in monospace font
- Re-worded last part of 4th paragraph to explain that no new PR is needed to open if there are linter errors or changes are requested. Now it's more clear, I thought.

You're still using the original bun executable.

We usually check whether the environment has AVX2 and run fallback functions instead of SIMD functions. I think it's the right way to support old devices.

I imagine you read the top of the README carefully and noticed this line: `bun is experimental software.` That means that, bun still being in beta, there can be (and you are to expect) issues that are not discovered yet, not documented and/or not patched yet. You can't expect `bun` to be as stable as `node`. Doc updates needs someone to fork the repo, commit changes, create a PR and wait for it to be reviewed and merged, so this takes time. Bun is relatively new and the v0.1.0 has been released 4 days ago.

I'm unsure where we ever stated that we will no longer look into the issue? The issue has been reported ~1 month-ish ago and is no show stopper.
General rule of thumb is, that is this an open source project, where everyone is welcome to contribute features, fixes or documentation (like in the nature of any other open source project).
You are more than welcome to look into it yourself and provide a solution that applies to a reproducible list of steps and help to fix your issue.

Many of us are working full time, are engaged with major exams or are involved in other time consuming projects.
PlotSquared is not the center of the universe everything else wraps around.
> For a payed plugin, it's the worst support I've ever seen.
You bought the plugin to support the people behind it. It's not a support contract with any obligation to deliver a solution to your problem in a specific time frame.

Describe the bug
After claiming a plot ""/plot claim"" I got teleported to it.
If I enter plot and type ""/plot delete"" nothing is happend. After typing it again the message ""A set block timer is bound to either the current plot or you. Please wait for it to finish."" appeared.
If the world is generated as a flat/normal world, this error didn't occurs.
To Reproduce
Generate a augmented or partial world with predefined/default values
Claim a plot
Get into the claimed plot
Show info of plot and make sure that you're the owner
Try to delete the plot (Nothing will be promted to the console)
Type the delete command once again to the console - error occurs

From an gamer only waiting play emulate current system is ""correct"" , but from an viewpoint of an professional game developer and emulator coder of mature projects emulate current system is totally wrong even if the law allow to do it.
Not is impossible Nintendo and others companies having contact with politics and changing the laws at point creating problems for other mature projects. Only reading an reply from an mamedev saying to stop wit it is enough to understand about it.
Unhappily an high percentage of PC gamers have done terrible actions demanding emulate and dump current comercial games ... all to avoid buy an console or even an recent released game doing problems from all sides.
I not believe here several gamers will reply with good sense saying to not add cores to current systems.
That's the because Sony and Nintendo add security protection in console OS.
Retroarch devs NOT add cores of current systems ... THAT IS AN OF MORE WORST PROBLEMS BEING DONE AGAINST MATURE PROJECTS ( MAME ).
If Retroarch continue using cores from before PS3 is all right and not any problem.
Now for example ... if is released an PS5 emulator and each PC have access to PS5 discs and that emulator is being extremely downloaded you believe Sony not will try to do the correct action ?
In past was tried stop some emulators (Connectix Virtual Game Station and others) ...
Today not is the same thing.
If Sony , Nintendo and any other company join to say about that problem to politics will happen problems.

I do not have any synthetic data, I use a real dataset that I cannot really share.
But if you pick any dataset from the Internet that has categorical variables or even better text then you can easily test what I describe.
It does not have to be only eg with categorical; it can be 9 numerical features and 1 categorical feature.
Especially if the categorical feature has some importance (although the same may happen if it does not; I have not tested that) and in your test set one observation has one unseen value for the categorical feature then the SGD results returns essentially random predictions (or at least not directly related).
It may be that scikitLearn implementation is fine but just SGD itself has this weakness in general?
I think though that RandomForestClassifier does not have the same problem in these cases.
I have not tested much the LogisticRegression.
even like that:
logistic_regression = LogisticRegression(penalty='elasticnet', tol=10, C=1.0, class_weight='balanced', random_state=0, solver='saga', max_iter=20, n_jobs=os.cpu_count()-1, l1_ratio=0.7)

The task is a classifier algorithm, let's say a data set with 9 numerical predictors and target label as class. For example, let's say you have dataset of len 1000 and your target label contains 5 classes - C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and there is only one observation for class C5. When you divide it for train and test, your train and test split algorithm has divided the classes C1, C2, C3, C4 divided in some proportion in both train and test, but because observation of class C5 is only one it gets allotted to test set. Now, when you train SGD classifier on train set and then test it on test set, the classifier breaks down for class C5 . Is my understanding correct ?"

I read GeorgeZan comment again, so here is my second understanding : input set X has 10 independent variables in which one variable is categorical. Along with that you have categorical dependent variable. Your test fails when there is a class in categorical I.V. which has not been seen in train data set while training and that's where you get random prediction. @GeorgeZan, please let me know, out of two examples, which one is correct."
4085,1072818585,988841478,Impatience,"@Nivi09, yes indeed.
""Hi @ogrisel, GeorgeZan has mentioned that - SGD results returns essentially random predictions (or at least not directly related).
I think this is what break down means.""
To give a hypothetical example, let's say I have a model with 9 numerical features and a categorical feature and let's say there are 3 classes in my problem (A, B, C class).
Let's also assume that I have a test set instance X that belongs to the A class.
Specifically, it belongs to class A regardless of the value of the categorical feature.
At best, the categorical feature can help the model to predict class A for X just by inference but it is not a defining feature of X.
i)
If I keep the categorical feature in the model and the test set instance X provided has a known/seen value at the categorical feature then the model returns the following prediction:
A: 0.7
C: 0.2
B: 0.1
iI)
If I drop the categorical feature from the model then the model returns the following prediction:
A: 0.55
C: 0.35
B: 0.1
iii)
If I keep the categorical feature in the model and the test set instance provided has a unknown/unseen value at the categorical feature then the model returns the following prediction:
B: 0.5
A: 0.3
C: 0.2
.........................
Obviously the impact of the categorical features in all these cases depends on how important is the feature for the model; in the example above it is assumed that the categorical feature has quite significant weight.
This is also why in (ii) the top score drops by quite a lot in comparison with (i) given that it is only one feature.
However, and this is what I mean that the model ""breaks down"", in (iii) it returns essentially random predictions.
It does not make sense to me that if you just receive an unseen value your prediction changes so so much.
I would expect (iii) to be more like (ii).
The even more interesting and problematic thing is that the same thing happens as mentioned at my original post if you have eg 100k tf-idf sparse features and just one categorical at the same model and if you put an unseen value at the categorical at the test set then SGD ""breaks down"" as in (iii).
In the dataset that I experimented the categorical feature is quite significant (eg dropping it reduced the overall accuracy of the model by 5 percentage points; eg accuracy drops from 80% to 75%) but I would not exclude based on how unstable SGD is that the same thing would happen even if the feature is not that significant.
.........................
@ogrisel I think now it must be quite clear.
As I said, you can pick any dataset on the Internet which has also categoricals or you can even create a very basic one on Excel and I think you will observe what I mean."
4086,1072818585,989208269,None,"Hello @GeorgeZan , for the case 3 as you have mentioned:
If I keep the categorical feature in the model and the test set instance provided has a unknown/unseen value at the categorical feature then the model returns the following prediction:
B: 0.5

C: 0.2
So, to which class do you expect this example to belong to ? Because I'm confused here when you mentioned - - ' (iii) it returns essentially random predictions.
It does not make sense to me that if you just receive an unseen value your prediction changes so so much.

Although it is relative obvious what I mean.
My point is that if you have a known value at the categorical feature or a if you entirely drop the categorical feature then the model returns the right prediction (although with slightly different ""confidence"").
But when you put an unseen value at the categorical feature then the model returns random results although given (ii) essentially the categorical feature does not play much role in the prediction so (iii) should have been returning something more like (ii)."
4088,1072818585,996847749,None,"I don't think that there is anything wrong but I would not be able to be sure until we have an example showing the wrong behaviour and the expected behaviour.
Since `SGDClassifier` is a linear model, when it comes to categorical data, the type of encoding is rather important. So did you check the coefficients of your model? Did you use an `OneHotEncoder` for encoding your categories? Basically, the value of the ""unseen categories"" will have an impact depending on the coefficient of the associated variable."
4089,1072818585,998023134,None,"@glemaitre as I mention at my post, I put the categorical value in the text and then apply tf-idf on it.
In this sense you could say that I do one hot encoding on it (?).
I have not really used the categorical variable separately but when I did was with label encoder.
Even though not ideal because ""LabelEncoder can turn [dog,cat,dog,mouse,cat] into [1,2,1,3,2], but then the imposed ordinality means that the average of dog and mouse is cat."", still it should not break down so much with unseen values.
PS
""I don't think that there is anything wrong ""
Wrong or not, the question is why this happens like that with SGD and unseen values."

This encoding is thus ordinal. Now if your unseen value is mapped to 100 then it will induce 100 x coef on the output and thus it would go sideways."

Any thoughts on these or we entirely skipped my main question haha?
Secondly, not sure why it would go sideways like that ""Now if your unseen value is mapped to 100 then it will induce 100 x coef on the output and thus it would go sideways.""
Let's say that I do not have an unseen value but a seen one and specifically the one mapped to 99 which would induce a 99x coef then why this would not go equally sideways and the 100 would?"

The thing that goes sideways here would be to use some ordered pattern for a feature that does not have any and where an increment/decrement of the feature value induces an increment/decrement of `coef` on the target. So my example was just to mention that if your mapped unseen values are mapped to larger values then it would even have a larger impact on the target.
> not sure if you read carefully
I think I did but I don't think that you did. As mentioned by @ogrisel or myself, it would be much easier to understand the problem and if there is an issue by having a concrete Python piece of code. Up to now, I am still not sure what is the problem that you are trying to express. You are referring to unseen values. However, an unseen term not part of the `TfidfVectorizer` dictionary will not be used. So more generally because you were referring to categories, I tried to understand what encoding you are actually using because a linear model it will have a different impact on the decision.
So please provide a Python code snippet that we can run and discuss concretely about the issue that you observe."

So do not try to be too smart now.
But anyway if nobody can see what could be the problem without a dataset then I may try to construct something.
""So my example was just to mention that if your mapped unseen values are mapped to larger values then it would even have a larger impact on the target.""

The behaviour with unseen values is totally different and anyway as I said I do not even mostly encode the categorical but use it in the TF-IDF."

In case you cannot use CMake to consume glog, it is your responsibility to reconstruct the CMake configuration (flags, compiler and linker options, etc.) because simply linking against glog is generally not sufficient."

This was not evident from your description. Make sure to provide a complete minimal example without cherry picking parts that you believe to be relevant.
According to the linker error, there seems to be an ABI mismatch. If you use C++11 features you need to compile glog using the `-std=c++11` flag as well (e.g., by passing -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=11 when configuring glog using CMake).
> The error is much self-explanatory: error: use of overloaded operator '<<' is ambiguous (with operand types 'std::ostream')
You initially reported a linker error. Now it's compiler error. Which is it now?"

The Aqara Smart Wireless Switch (WXKG11LM), which was easy to add in previous version, can not be added anymore via Phoscon (see also #5585).
## Steps to reproduce the behavior
1. Go to 'Switches""
2. Click on 'Add Switch'
3. Click on 'Others'
4. Press the reset button of the switch for ~ 5 seconds
In deconz a new node was created, but in Phoscon nothing happens.
## Expected behavior
Pairing should work in Phoscon as it worked in the previous 2.12.06 version
## Screenshots

DXVK itself does not leak memory but it's possible that the game keeps creating resources for some reason, or uses `MAP_WRITE_DISCARD` on very large resources.

```
I'm not sure why radvd would be using that file over the one in /var/etc/ though, as it's hard coded to use the /var/etc conf:
https://github.com/opnsense/core/blob/master/src/etc/inc/plugins.inc.d/dhcpd.inc#L567
` mwexec('/usr/local/sbin/radvd -p /var/run/radvd.pid -C /var/etc/radvd.conf -m syslog');`

A network that doesn't work. Even if I didn't care about SLAAC (which I do) RA is required."
4194,1092238495,1008273422,Impatience,I’m sorry to say this is a waste of both of our time.
4195,1092238495,1024960967,None,"I had the same issue of radvd not starting up after the update from 21.7.8 to 22.1.
I have multiple interfaces configured with static IPv6 + DHCP6 + managed RA, so in my understanding it definitely needs to be run.
On the old version it was still running, after the update not running anymore.
On the old version, DHCP6 was still working, after the update DHCP6 and therefore IPv6 on these managed networks was completely broken (apart from the statically configured IP6s).
Can't say anything about SLAAC since we don't use it on any network.
Trying to start radvd manually didn't help.
Log entries nowhere to be found unfortunately.
Curiously, `/var/etc/radvd.conf` was completely empty which can't be correct.
I've found a workaround though, which I wanted to share here:
If you go to **Services -> Router Advertisements -> Some Interface** and just click on save, the config will be rewritten and radvd will start up again.
In my case, this fixed the DHCP6 problems.
I did the save thing for any interface that was shown in the RA menu there to be sure.
The fix seems to persist across reboots as well, so I think it only needs to be applied once after the update to fix things.
So I guess this is some kind of problem where the config gets lost during the upgrade and doesn't get rewritten afterwards.
And btw:
> Radvd only starts when you configure tracking Interfaces
Either I'm misunderstanding something or this claim is false, since I don't have any tracking interfaces (or is DHCP6 only managed interface also tracking?) and still radvd is needed, so it needs to be started (and did start in prior versions, and now starts again after applying the workaround)."
4196,1092238495,1028607075,Bitter frustration,"> I’m sorry to say this is a waste of both of our time.
@fichtner: I’m sorry to say this is a waste of my time... and many more people who have broken IPv6 after update, because you released broken version, while this was known issue for a month. Sorry, but I simply don't understand your dismissive attitude towards @brad0. It is not his job to debug and fix the issue.
Anyway, back to the issue. `/var/etc/radvd.conf` is cleared during the update, even tho in the web gui configuration looks ok, one need to change something, save and change back to regenerate `radvd.conf`. And @megmug seems to confirm that. Once you start digging it is easy to fix, but I guess you can agree that desynchronized settings in gui/system is not something that is immediately seen as a solution. And not everyone like @brad0 have to know how to fix that.
> That makes absolutely no sense. Who broke things?
@brad0: They did... You did nothing wrong. Upgrade process broke your settings."

yes all
## Describe the bug [Required]
The `env` object in an entry of the configuration `latex-workshop.latex.tools` will not allow case insensitivity on windows, and leads to confusion on the end user.
Set the configuration
```js
""latex-workshop.latex.tools"": [
{
""command"": ""latexmk"",
...
""env"": {
""PATH"": ""foo""
}
}, ...
```
and build with `latexmk`.
- Expected behavior: `""foo""` is used to run `foo/latexmk`
- Actual behavior: `process.env.Path` is used instead
## Logs [Required]
Irrelevant. It's a problem with `process.env` and `cs.spawn()` on Windows.

Older versions required .NET Framework 4.8, which was installed by default.
In order for it to be truly portable, the download size will go up to 78MB.
I could add that download option in future releases."
4209,1096297382,1007916684,None,@NickeManarin That would be cool. I don't care much about portability - but bundling ScreenToGif with the needed .NET6 files insetad of requiring a systemwide .NET6 install would be very welcome. Other popular software (such as paint.net) already go this way.

I can make it more convenient, but the file size will go to 140MB (78MB compressed) and the update system won't work the same way that it works now.
Also, I don't need to explain myself as to why I did something with my project (but it's easy to guess why or easy to search for .NET Framework to .NET 6 comparisons online)."

4220,1100051808,1012383729,None,"I would think it would, in order to maintain SOLID code. Also, as several other people pointed out previously, we are not always immune to managers etc. making us code to interfaces, do gratuitous TDD and automated-unit-test writing etc/mocking, and/or use IoC containers. Bosses like to make software engineers do things ""because I heard about it at a conference,"" or ""the insurance is making us,"" etc.
The interface just supporting the two methods is, in principle, okay -- just make sure that the static extension methods refer to the object through the interface and not the actual class."
4221,1100051808,1012444622,None,"Brian, I understand the argument about managers, although in my 30 years of engineering I never encountered a single manager who was telling me how to write code... I mean, if you write your code against an interface it's one thing. But how some managers can tell a third-party library how to write _their_ code? `HttpClient` doesn't have any interfaces implemented and it seems to be fine, no?
Automated testing and mocking HTTP requests are totally possible with RestSharp in its current shape. I have shown an option in the docs.
I see no issues with using DI containers as well, as `HttpClient` does with its nice extensions. In fact, I plan to add some DI support to make it easier and push people to use RestSharp properly (typed clients, etc).
The SOLID argument is not solid :) What do you mean by that, could you elaborate?
Then again, I am seriously not against adding that small interface. However, I would not be happy to add `IRestRequest` and `IRestResponse` back as those are glorified property bags."
4222,1100051808,1015063559,None,"A typical method in a wrapper service for my HTTP calls does the following
1. Take some inputs to form a request
2. Execute
3. Handle response (maybe retry, return data)
If I can mock `IRestClient`, then I can verify the contents of the `RestRequest` given to it by my method. That lets me avoid splitting 1 into a separate method just for testing that I correctly crafted the web request (which I want because string formatting is tricky).
If I can mock `IRestClient`, then I can setup responses for 200, 404, 401, etc and don't need to split out 3 either.
Each method is already short enough that I _don't want_ to split it up just for test coverage. Example:
```csharp
public async Task<List<Something>> GetData(DateTimeOffset startEpoch, DateTimeOffset endEpoch)
{
var request = new RestRequest(""/url"", Method.GET);
await AddBearerToken(request);// other method which might make a request to authenticate or use cached token
request.AddQueryParameter(""start"", startEpoch.ToUnixTimeSeconds().ToString());
request.AddQueryParameter(""end"", endEpoch.ToUnixTimeSeconds().ToString());
var result = await _client.ExecuteAsync<ApiResponseModel>(request);
if (result.StatusCode != HttpStatusCode.OK)
throw new Exception($""Failed to fetch data. Status code: \""{(int)result.StatusCode}\"", message: \""{result.StatusDescription}\"""");
return result.Data.ThingICareAbout;
}

Can you tell a little bit more about your plans on DI support? Perhaps a word on DI in the docs could clarify many questions before the've to be asked."
4225,1100051808,1015313118,None,"The DI registration heavily depends if you want to follow the same pattern as Microsoft does, using `IHttpClientFactory`, registering the client as a transient dependency.
For many use cases it's enough to register a typed client as a singleton:
```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IMyApiClient>(new MyApiClient(new RestClient(options)));
```
If I'd to provide some use of `IHttpClientFactory` registration extensions, I'd need to know if people want to configure the `HttpClient` instance used by `RestClient` on the outside. In this case, lots of options that RestSharp uses to configure the message handler won't be applicable."
4226,1100051808,1015671496,None,"> @fjmorel what of that is not possible to do with [MockHttp](https://github.com/richardszalay/mockhttp)? It gives you even better options to ensure the request comes in the correct format and has the correct content type, authorisation headers, etc.
Thanks! I didn't know about that library. I've been using [Moq.Contrib.HttpClient](https://github.com/maxkagamine/Moq.Contrib.HttpClient) in places we used HttpClient rather than RestSharp.
This library using HttpClient is an implementation detail that I don't think library users should have to think about, unless they have specific requirements making the need for a custom HttpClient necessary. Having the interface makes testing easier for all users without having to add extra dependencies."
4227,1100051808,1015729443,None,"The library you mentioned would work as well. As long as you can add a delegating handler, it will be possible to test RestSharp calls. All you need to do is to compose or override the message handler used by the wrapped HttpClient:
```csharp
var client = new RestClient(...) { ConfigureMessageHandler = _ => mockedHandler };
```
Basically, one of the benefits of moving to HttpClient (besides that it's obvious and `HttpWebRequest` is heavy legacy) is the ability to use delegating handlers and build message processing pipelines.
The point about testing real requests is obvious to me. If you look at StackOverflow questions about RestSharp, most of the issues are caused by incorrectly added parameters, content type overrides and other weird things. But, if people would test against a RestShar interface, they would have all their tests passing. But it won't work anyway, because the request is just not correctly formed. It's a great benefit to at least inspect the actual request and ensure that it looks exactly as it should, rather than inspecting the parameters collection on a `RestRequest` instance. The latter gives you zero idea how the actual request would look like."
4228,1100051808,1021443552,None,This is not necessary if the existing RestClient methods are marked virtual. This will allow for mocking overrides of the public methods instead of needing a full interface. One of the two is necessary as the handler system is not able to simulate invalid http responses. We switched from Http client to RestSharp because RestSharp had an interface that allowed us to simulate the result of those responses as well as other error conditions not simulatable through the mock handler. Some of these result in StatusCode 0 or exceptions being thrown which require an interface or virtual method.
4229,1100051808,1021542279,None,@sspates-starbucks why can't you simulate the error response with a testing handler like `MockHttp`? It provides a behaviour that is much closer to reality. It can return anything you want based on its configuration.
4230,1100051808,1021543020,None,@maor-rosenfeld thanks for your extensive and elaborative feedback for this issue.
4231,1100051808,1021563475,None,"If we keep discussing testing, maybe it's a good idea to post some test samples and check how these tests can be refactored. So far, the discussion goes quite theoretical imo."
4232,1100051808,1024188857,None,"@alexeyzimarev we can argue all day about use cases of using the interface for tests, extension methods, tests on these extension methods and other reasons of why suddenly removing all interfaces from an existing infrastructure package is a bad idea, but at this point it's clear that you're here to tell us how to write code. I'm sorry if I choose not to align with your views, but at this point upgrading to the latest version of RestSharp is so painful that there's really no justification to even try. On a positive note, I'm completely with you regarding the separation of services and settings objects. I like `RestClientOptions`."
4233,1100051808,1024358874,Mocking,@maor-rosenfeld you definitely know how to motivate OSS maintainers to keep doing their community work for free.
4234,1100051808,1025970935,None,"I've come here from a breaking scenario that I'm not sure I can fix other than backing out the upgrade to 107 due to missing IRestClient.
I updated one of my libraries to use 107. Why not right? I'm trying to be proactive with keeping libs up to date. It all seemed to work OK until some tests starting failing. This is because we use a third-party library and they reference IRestClient and v106 of the library. I could ask them to update but I don't see that they would prioritise that and it would then force all of their customers to update to v107 as well which might be a big deal. If I use an assembly redirect to 107, it won't work because it won't find IRestClient and if I use 106, my code won't work because the method signatures changed.
I'm not sure what I would have done differently but perhaps something as simple a a different nuget package with different namespaces and mark the old one as deprecated. Then we can run them side-by-side until everyone is on 107?
Not sure. Any suggestions?"
4235,1100051808,1026613361,None,"@lukos I don't think it would work in any scenario, interfaces or not. RestSharp v107 internals are completely different due to migration to `HttpClient` and ditching `HttpWebRequest`. It made it impossible to keep the API backwards compatible, and even with interfaces, the API scope of those interfaces won't ever be compatible.

Those mindsets aren't even usually the mindset of the developer using your library, they're probably dictated by the organisation they work for and having a conversation to change those standards is either way above their pay grade or a battle that's not worth fighting. The problem here isn't one of who is right or wrong, it's one of practicality. The removal of the interfaces causes the amount of work some consumers have to do to significantly increase. Most devs really just need to deliver the work they had promised within the timeframe promised. I'm a huge fan of MockHttp but in my case, updating over 1000 tests to use it (which were written 5 years ago) is a huge amount of work. No matter how you plan your pipeline, the sizing of the work item is now completely invalid. The amount of work required to update your library has become inhibitive to doing so - it will either have to be picked up as a separate work item or it just won't ever get updated.
Irrespective of whether consumers are testing the right thing, using IoC correctly or just plain writing crap code, they no longer have the flexibility to choose like they used to. I think most devs would agree that the code changes make sense but at the end of the day we all need to deliver functionality to a business and I guarantee that those business users really don't care how well the code is written as long as it reliably does what they need. The best development tools out there make our lives easier. That's why we use them - they abstract us away from the detail/hard work we really don't need to care about and they provide flexibility to customise how we utilise them.

It seems like the best way out of it would be to create a separate library with a different name/package name (and importantly, different namespaces) to contain your newer/better way of doing things and which should be used by people going forwards. Any serious bugs found in the old library will probably be fixed but otherwise it won't get any new features.
This way, we can have both packages alongside each other so if we can update our own code for the new library we can do that without forcing all of our dependencies to update all of their code at the same time. If they eventually do, then we can eventually uninstal the old package.

But my biggest problem is the change to DI because of options. I have an app that connects to 10 different services. Currently I have them all getting an IRestClient via DI, set the options they need in their consumer's constructors, and move on.
You are asking me to create 10 new interfaces, move all that rest configuration logic into the DI configuration, change the signature of every consumer of the rest client etc. Further, if two services can currently share configuration they can share the injected interface. But if one of them needs a different bit of configuration in the future, now I have to create a new interface for that DI again, and change the signatures again, just to have a different timeout or base url.

This issue is a place where we should have a civilised discussion about it. I will not follow up on the interface issue anywhere else, except here.
Some details about the current state of the `RestClient` API signature.
- All the sync methods were removed. Those who need it can make extensions, wrapping up async calls in some [async helper](https://github.com/rebus-org/Rebus/blob/master/Rebus/Bus/Advanced/AsyncHelpers.cs).
- Most of the overloads for making requests are now extensions, as they just call each other, so they would never be part of any interface anyway.
- Most of the options that were previously on `IRestClient` and `IRestRequest` are now in `RestClientOptions`, which is a property bag and, therefore, won't have any interface
So, what's there in stock for `IRestClient`? Basically, it boils down to this signature:
```csharp
namespace RestSharp; public interface IRestClient {
RestClient AddDefaultParameter(Parameter parameter);
Task<RestResponse> ExecuteAsync(RestRequest request, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}

Features like delegating handlers allow you to intersect the request pipeline, inspect the request, and substitute the response. You can do it yourself, or use a library like [MockHttp](https://github.com/richardszalay/mockhttp)
this requires me to actually know how you're making your calls inside your library that you publish to nuget. The main reason people wants to use external libraries is to not be concerned about the internals of that external code. It also assumes I know to use this MockHttp library (had no idea it existed, I didnt need to since I've used RestSharp to handle all ""HttpClient"" related things so far), with the assumption that, that package will also be maintained properly and will not be making breaking changes.
> Mocking an infrastructure component like RestSharp (or HttpClient) is not the best idea.
This statement is also wrong in my opinion. I think the opposite actually, making us test external library code in our _unit_ tests implicitly makes them not unit tests, because we are always testing more than a small ""unit"" of code, in addition to our code change, now we're testing your code.
> As RestSharp uses HttpClient internally
What happens when you decide to not use HttpClient, but use ""MyGrandmasHttpClient"". Do we then have to refactor all of our code bases with the ""MockMyGrandmasHttpClient"" package?
I am fine with removing every other interface on this package. Except for that single one.
This wouldn't be an issue if we were able to mock classes like Java allows, however removing this 1 single interface with 1 single method causes design issues, as well as wasted hours for millions of developers. I would also be skeptical about the suggested ""if you don't like 107, just remain on 106"" By it's nature, RestSharp deals with connectivity, that increases the chances of 0 day vulnerabilities or other security issues. We won't be able remain on 106 forever, and would be forced off of this package. Which would be a shame because we love RestSharp.
I really appreciate your work on maintaining this package, there is a reason it's one of the most popular packages on .NET. I hope you reconsider this decision."

That's an exaggeration. RestSharp uses elements of .NET under the hood, and for many years it was `WebRequest`. Then, Microsoft decided to scrap it and re-implemented it using `HttpClient`, causing massive problems. Essentially, RestSharp uses the only way available in core .NET to make HTTP calls, and it's `HttpClient` until Microsoft decides to do something else. All other .NET libs for making HTTP calls like Refit or Flur also use `HttpClient`, and most people use `HttpClient` directly. So, when _that_ changes, all the code for .NET will need to change, which is very unlikely.
> This statement is also wrong in my opinion.
The issue here is that by creating an interface mock you will assert if the client is formed according to your idea of how it should be formed. However, it doesn't guarantee that the actual HTTP request will be valid. That's why `HttpClient` has no interface and cannot be mocked. And that's why people normally use a test version of `HttpMessageHandler` instead, as `HttpClient` itself is just forming a message, but the actual _oevr the wire_ implementation is in the handler. See this [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36425008/mocking-httpclient-in-unit-tests).
> I have to disagree with this. I don't think calling actual services from unit tests is good practice.
You don't have to call the actual service, you can call a simulation. That's what many RestSharp tests do for making sure that the server can understand the request in the way it should.
Again, I am not against bringing the interface back, but it won't be the original interface. Essentially, there are just a handful of core functions of the client itself (`ExecuteAsync` is the main one), all the others are just extensions.
I actually think that the interface would help for building something like a retryable client with Polly, as it could be done in a wrapper using composition."

`services.AddTransient<RestSharp.IRestClient, RestSharp.RestClient>();`
Then just need to define this in the constructor and thats it, you can use RestSharp in the class
`public ValidationDataAccess(IRestClient restClient)`
For the unit test I use Moq, so I only neet to define the result of method Execute like this
`var moq = new Mock<IRestClient>();
moq.Setup(m => m.Execute<T>(It.IsAny<RestRequest>()))
.Returns(new RestResponse<T>()
{
ErrorMessage = string.Empty,
Data = data

And pass to the constructor like this
`var validationDA = new ValidationDataAccess(moq);`
If I need that RestClient response with an error then I define the result of Execute with an error to test that escenario.
So, for me the problems is the next
- We neet to refactory not just new projects but projects in production only for use the new version
- You say ""just don't update the version"". @Terebi42 say one reason what we neet to update
- You say ""in your unit test you can call a simulation"", but again it's needed time to refactory the projects
- You say ""I don't remember a single library I used that never changed its API"", yes you have right but always that cause troubles and discomfort in developers
- You say this in using of mock ""it doesn't guarantee that the actual HTTP request will be valid"", maybe but that´s why we test local and QA"

- Change all extensions of `RestClient` to `IRestClient`. There will be issues with client members that should be included in the interface, so add those too. `Options` is the property I expect to be there.
This will allow composition. For example, I can add a Polly-based wrapped client to retry particular status codes. Btw, I found that the number of retries in the response `Request` property might not work as intended.
How does that sound?"

But I don't think exposing options is necessary at all in order for someone to mock up IRestClient is it?"
4286,1100051808,1320452997,None,"Because lots of extensions need those options. So, it's either to extend the API surface of the interface, which makes little sense or expose a shared options container via the interface."
4287,1100051808,1320839687,None,I guess I took the wrong approach. The internal execute method should remain internal or private. Both `ExecuteAsync` and `DownloadStreamAsync` should be in the interface as it's the basic public API.

I would also argue that new users should come in contact with code formatters early on their learning journey, as writing readable code is just as important as writing functional ones. By keeping the feature as default, you make it more likely that new users will find this feature. Most people will not thoughtfully read all documentation and optional before starting to use a product, and by keeping it as default it's very easy to present the feature to new users. Keeping opt out as default is a good strategy for product rollout. Those who end up disliking the feature should have a easy time disabling it. According to the [docs](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/intro.html#setting-configurable-options
), you can disable it inside the terminal, on the command line, on the profile files, on the default profile. There is just so many ways to do so, that should fit most needs.

I think having an option to auto-format code in the CLI and Jupyter cells is terrific. That being said, it being the default is rallying people against auto-formatting so it's somewhat counterproductive to what we want to achieve.
Note that I don't necessarily agree with taking any change to Python, or third-party projects like in this case, hostage to some nebulous case of ""educating new users"". It's trivial to demonstrate semicolon usage and other changes which would be auto-formatted away. In fact, it would be also educational to inform users **why** those things are getting auto-formatted away. Semicolons and backslashes are pretty uncontroversially discouraged in user code, no?
I know that the biggest point of contention is standardizing double quotes. I don't want to reopen the single quotes discussion but [the choice was made after evaluating both variants](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/51#issuecomment-376204207). Saying that ""Python itself prefers single quotes"" is anthropomorphicizing a piece of software. It's silly. Again, educating new users would be more complete with an explanation of the reasons why standardizing quotes is done and why one is better than the other.
But I digress. The more important issue is auto-formatting scientific math-heavy lines. There isn't much that can be magically done by a simple tool like Black here *in a consistent manner*. We are evaluating improvements in this area, specifically in the most often brought up case of [hugging power operands](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/2726). That being said, I don't think this will be an area where everybody will be happy whatever Black does.
So, the actions IPython maintainers can take now are as follows:
1. make it explicitly opt-in;
2. make it much easier to opt out;
3. stop depending on Black by default.
My personal preference would be to definitely do 3. but also 2. Depending on Black brings a number of other dependencies to the venv which might not be in the versions people want. And opting out even if Black is importable shouldn't require me to bring up the docs for the magical incantation every time. It should be trivial to remember. (something like `# fmt: off`)

4312,1104666990,1013714865,None,"Since you mentioned semicolons: It's not very uncommon to write concise one-liners - focus one ONE line - in the REPL when you want to do something quickly. For example importing and calling a function. This is a convenient one-liner in history then if you need to restart to apply code changes (`reload()` isn't particularly good if you changed multiple files).
But let's take a simple example: `foo = ""bar""; 2 * foo`
This is formatted to two lines:
```python
In [1]: foo = ""bar""
...: 2 * foo
Out[1]: 'barbar'
```
Now that's a multi-line statement in the history, which IMHO is actually less readable. If you do it with an actual import and function call it's even clearer.

To this and similar suggestions, 'black' auto-formatting has been opt-in for 2 years (may 1st 2020, IPython 7.14).
I had thought it might be problematic, but in two years received almost no bug reports. I tried a few time to say I was considering making it default and only got positive feedback. So I did it, with extensive alpha, beta, and RC time to complain and ask for modifications.
So here is my challenge, if I don't make it the default, no-one know about it. It's astonishing that no-one found the bug @ehamiter described above in 2 years ! That alone would have definitely delayed the release, and at least I would have had tried to fix it.
I've also seen a number of new users misformating Python code and taking really bad habits in the Repl, including folks that did not even realise IPython terminal was multiline. For many of those users black by default is much better. You get use to proper code formatting. So you learn to properly _read_ python code.
And it is much easier to deactivate something you don't like than even figure out it something that may exists. For many users this benefits to, having this option be opt-in would make black auto formatting be part of the [unknown unknowns].(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns). So I will _never_ get feedback from these. This is in the same vein as ""but you can configure vim to do so"". > 2. make it much easier to opt out;
It's really hard to make it much easier, there have been a long standing issue to have persistent config, but that's far beyond the time and funds we have for that in IPython. We could borrow a nice configuration interface like ptpython for the UI if Someone want to take a shot at ti. > 3. stop depending on Black by default.
(As black is beta I agree that this is a problem I did not foresaw and will likely be removing at least the dependency, though I don't really like that either).
As many have pointed out, it's expected for major release to receive feedback because few users try `--pre`, and other channel, and it's ok I expect it. But I much prefer a reaction like:
https://twitter.com/jnuneziglesias/status/1478867554009452545

I do not know whether you were already aware of this but we are aiming to mark Black as stable by the end of the month (hopefully, staying on time is hard in OSS).

Python itself is a language, where you have to check next version to make your library or tool to be compatible on day 1. IPython is a tool, which meant to be stable.

I cannot even begin to tell you how much I disagree with this, speaking as a data scientist who works a lot with analysts who are new to python.
Pandas is a great library, but it almost encourages the writing of unreadable code. Since enabling `black` auto-formatting, I have found my own data processing to be 200% more legible (and has made typos, bugs and flaws 500% more obvious).
Beyond the toll on tech debt and throughput, needing to worry about the ""proper"" way to format code has a real psychological toll. An analyst once handed off a notebook containing a few hundred lines of code. They apologized for the ""how bad"" their code was. Literally all I had to do was run, `black-nb`, and suddenly I was staring at some of the most careful, clever and well-constructed python I'd ever seen, albeit with a ton of copy-paste (DRY would arguably have been an antipattern for this use case).
Similarly, I set up all of our team repos--including where we store our ""lab notebooks""--to run black (and isort) via pre-commit. I expected the junior team members to struggle with that. Instead, the feedback I received was gratitude that they didn't really have to learn or worry about all the various PEP8 rules; and relief that they didn't have to apply a dozen formatting rules during PRs.
In these ways, `black`-by-default leads not only to an essentially free jump in code quality and an easy ramp for new python programmers to get comfortable with the language's code conventions, but a demonstrable _empowerment_ of coders of all skill and experience levels to feel confident that their code is worthy of sharing without feeling self-conscious just because they don't always know the best place to put line breaks.
Thank you, IPython team, for doing this. This is a huge step for software integrity and for making python more accessible to the vast majority of programmers and python users who will benefit from having linted code out of the box. Let the experts who ""know what they're doing"" and want the software to ""get out of their way"" build their own customizations and workarounds."

Also, in case the feature remains enabled by default: IIRC. sometimes the ipython config isn't loaded depending on how an application embeds it. Not sure if that's still the case with recent versions but if yes that'd mean you may sometimes not be able to disable it easily in every tool that embeds an ipython REPL.

In both cases, the reformatting defeats the author's effort to format data in a way that best communicates either what the code is doing or the structure of the data.
This applies broadly. Perhaps [critical research using Python2.7](https://www.gw-openscience.org/GW150914data/GW150914_tutorial.html) will be unaffected, but most tutorials and scientific papers will now look different to different viewers."

@rhettinger I share your concern that notebooks are different to modules. They are often intended to be executed rather than edited. Reformatting an existing notebook simply when a user executes it would therefore be a drastic change, if that were to happen.
But if I understand correctly, it hasn't happened. #13397 is a change to the IPython REPL (i.e. `IPython/terminal/interactiveshell.py`). It does not affect notebooks at all! I cannot reproduce the behavior you describe in a notebook, and the diff you post is not the diff of a notebook file but rather a diff of python code. Could you be more specific about the steps to reproduce what you posted?"
4329,1104666990,1013984240,None,"I am incredibly confused by all this talk about how these changes would negatively impact classroom instruction and reference documentation. Any programming book I've read or data science tutorial I've ever found is written with the knowledge that languages evolve--especially when we're talking about packages outside the standard library. How many guides had to be rewritten or were rendered obsolete when [`pandas` deprecated](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/14218)--and soon after removed--`.ix`? I personally spent at least two weeks updating a SQLAlchemy toolkit to conform to the new [2.0 API](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/changelog/migration_20.html). And how often does _boto_ break backwards compatibility?
In my experience, all the guides and tutorials I've found _explicitly specify their versions_ and oftentimes contain instructions for setup, usually in my space in the form of a `conda` `environment.yml`. I won't even get into how containerization makes things even easier by making sandbox creation literally push-button. So if auto-formatting is really that big of a deal for your class--aren't your setup instructions already pinning your version of python, IPython and what-have-you? If not, well, that's really way more of a problem than anything else you're bringing up.

If you want to see how a Jupyter notebook _would_ reformat, [`jupyter_code_formatter` is my everything](https://jupyterlab-code-formatter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)--and even there it's push-button, not automatic.

Forcing me to format with black by default makes a tool I use for years much less valuable for me and my students then the simple python REPL. The best solution I see from this dispute is to publish an official `ipython-black` package which just change the default to format using black and nothing else, leaving the setting inside iPython configuration for whom want to change it in their configuration files. And make it default if mounthly download report for a plugin is comparable to ipython itself @meawoppl you can bribe maintainers, but you cannot bribe whole community

- the change we're talking about reverting does not affect notebooks (AFAICT!)
- [the scenario described in this comment](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/13463#issuecomment-1013975665) does not happen (or at least I can't reproduce it)

At this point there's clear pushback from the community, with plenty of technically-reasoned support for why this ended up being a controversial move.

I do not exclude to fix the magic and semi-colon problem and maybe re-enable black at some point in the future, even just because for some feature it seem the only way to get feedback and bug reports.

For LuckPerms this can be traced to their use of Commodore, but both use the old (< 1.13) methods of registering commands, which is why they broke when Forge updated to explicitly require support for these.
From the author of the Client Commands PR that exposed this problem:
> seems like both bungeecord and luckperms send the commands but they don't mark them as executable since they are only sending them in brigadier format for the client since they both still use the command registration method that was removed in 1.13 on the backend"

4386,1128211306,1033488121,Bitter frustration,"## The issues
Many polite attempts were made to resolve the disagreements with reasoning, most of them were [ignored]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-965201571 ). This complaint abandons that approach to describe the severity of the issues with clarity.
### Inappropriate procedure
The [proposal]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issue-677390392 ) and the discussion did not follow the proper procedure outlined in the [new features guideline]( https://whatwg.org/faq#adding-new-features ), yet it was accepted as the de facto solution. The following steps were skipped:
1. ""Forget about the particular solution you have in mind!"" - The lead editor had a specific solution in mind: [""the use case for this proposal is when you don't want a <form>""]( https://twitter.com/domenic/status/1438229658324111360 ) and aggressively rejected any other solution.
1. ""What are the use cases?"" - I had to collect [these]( https://kaleidea.github.io/whatwg-search-proposal/#use-cases )
1. ""list requirements for each use case""
1. ""Ask fellow web developers about their opinions"" - Domenic described [web developers' input]( https://kaleidea.github.io/whatwg-search-proposal/#:~:text=Optional%3A%20Clarification%20notes-,Requests%20for%20this%20feature,-tweet%20%2D%20%E2%80%9CUsing%20a ) as [""confusion""]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-956454034 ) and as [""makes no sense""]( https://twitter.com/domenic/status/1438229658324111360 ). Incorrect and very disrespectful.
1. ""Research existing solutions."" - Not even the [best practice]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Search_role ) was considered.
1. ""Come up with new solutions."" - The only new solution was [immediately rejected]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7323#issuecomment-965145881 ) without consideration.
1. ""Evaluate how well each of the remaining solutions address each use case and how well they meet the requirements."" - Domenic left the discussion after the new solution was proposed, his [last comment]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-965201571 ) was personal and inappropriate.
### Inconsistency with the WHATWG principles: openness, efficiency
I've worked weeks to research this problem domain, compared to the few hours demonstrated by the editor. Instead of appreciating my hard work, he [immediately closed]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7323#issuecomment-965145881 ), [censored]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/7320#pullrequestreview-802253725 ) and [rejected]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-965201571 ) it: ""I'll be closing or marking as off-topic any such discussions outside of this issue.""
Recently the editor prevented me from contributing 2 months' work to Chromium by revoking access to chromestatus.com, when I asked to file an *Intent to prototype*. Progress has been stalled since then. By doing so he also prevented the involvement of the chromium developer community, who might have views different from his."
4387,1128211306,1033488202,None,"## Accountability
The editor refused to answer the following [questions]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-964879335 ) fundamental to his decisions:
1. Why inheritance is unviable? (Why duplication is, is obvious.)
1. What form functionality is unwanted (explicitly opposed) for the `<search>` element with `div` semantics?
1. What developer feedback led to that decision?
Related, but [different]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-979156406 ):
4. Why do you assume that form functionality is ""unviable""?
All these assumptions were proven wrong. The editor is expected to answer these questions and present verifiable (reproducible) evidence to justify his decisions.
Further questions:
5. Have you discussed with the chromium team the proposal with form functionality before [rejecting it]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7323#issuecomment-965145881 ) in November? Link to public records.
5. Who discussed it from the chromium team at that time?"
4388,1128211306,1033488303,None,"### Working mode violation
[Working mode]( https://whatwg.org/working-mode#conflicts ):
> In case of a conflict among the community of contributors, the editor is expected to go to significant length to resolve disagreements.
The editor made no attempt to resolve the disagreement, instead made a number of [attempts to suppress]( https://github.com/whatwg/sg/issues/186 ) this POV, to prevent me from contributing and getting in contact with chromium developers who might have different thoughts.
### Bad decisions
The editor based its decisions on the following flawed assumptions and misunderstandings:
1. [comment]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-958169793 ): ""The form element is quite magical, and duplicating that magic into another element is a huge implementation and spec lift""
- Nobody proposed duplication. Reuse is key to efficient and maintainable software.
1. [comment]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-961877504 ): 'a new element ""inheriting from form"" is not viable'
- The rejected solution is trivially implemented without inheritance in all 3 main browsers. Its impact on the ecosystem is similarly trivial.
These claims were repeated multiple times after being disproven, creating counterproductive noise and misleading other participants."
4389,1128211306,1033488402,None,"## Recommended solution
I offer a mutually beneficial solution to the editor: there are many features in progress that are more relevant, impactful, and important for the editor. This, however, is a simple, low-priority feature that received only a few hours of attention from the editor and none in the last months. The editor's extensive standardization experience creates more value applied to those more important features.
I wrote the [specification and implemented]( https://kaleidea.github.io/whatwg-search-proposal/ ) the search element in 3 browsers. I've invested more effort into it than all other participants combined. I offer to take on the responsibility of being the editor for this topic, so Domenic can focus on more valuable topics and both our work benefits the HTML standard. This is a very generous offer in [the current context]( https://github.com/whatwg/sg/issues/186 ).
To address the concerns of other participants about the assumed risks I propose to run the origin trial with form functionality and evaluate the feedback from web developers. In case the risks are proven to be substantial the chosen solution will be without form functionality and I will submit the appropriate implementations.
I'm taking the brunt of the work upon myself to minimize the time investment needed from other participants. I hope this solution is an acceptable middle ground and the attitude towards my work will change for the better."

## The reason
### Why is this important?
DX. Developers wish that native HTML-JS solutions would be on par with the ease of use and efficiency provided by frameworks.
In this standardization process [developers' requests]( https://kaleidea.github.io/whatwg-search-proposal/#:~:text=Optional%3A%20Clarification%20notes-,Requests%20for%20this%20feature,-tweet%20%2D%20%E2%80%9CUsing%20a ) were ignored and [inappropriately described]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-956454034 ) as ""confusion"".
### Why do I disagree with multiple participants?
EDIT: As a seasoned software architect I outrank other participants in the $topic domain of software design. I see the solutions where many others see unmanagable complexity.
No other participant has done the necessary research to prepare this standard. I have spent about 2 months researching and implementing this feature in all 3 main browsers. With that knowledge, as a seasoned software architect, I have much deeper understanding of the implementation details and risks. As a comparison, I estimate other participants spent a few hours (few comments), Scott a few days (specification + examples).
I have found that the claims of the other participants (Domenic and Scott) are technically wrong assumptions that have no evidence. They did not provide evidence for their claims when [asked to do so]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-964879335 ). The request was simply ignored.
I have documented the research and evidence in 15+ page-length comments and a [proposal]( https://kaleidea.github.io/whatwg-search-proposal ). They have repeatedly rejected and ignored the documentation and evidence that I've presented, for ex.
- Domenic has [immediately closed]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7323#issuecomment-965145881 ) the issue I've filed.
- Scott has repeated in the [January triage meeting]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/7385 ) the first fundamental question (""people who don't want form behavior"") that has been answered repeatedly, months ago: [1]( https://kaleidea.github.io/whatwg-search-proposal/div-functionality ), [2]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-961785189 ), [3]( https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5811#issuecomment-981973258 ).
Professional collaboration cannot be conducted in this manner. If other participants would have done the necessary research or just respected the enormous effort I did, they would understand their concerns are non-existent risks."

4397,1134552993,1049716642,None,"it was closed because turns out i can read the items in the terminal, just not take them. But idk if it's due to the fact that default user has only read access or if it's a special perm for OP players. That was enough for my needs at the time so i didn't bothered much.
If you ask me, that protection is purely silly and operators should have full access to any stuff on the server. If the operator is doing questionable actions with his powers then that's on Dream and I because we trusted the wrong person to be staff. And if any player complains about this because we would gain full access to their AE, i want to say that we can bypass it in several ways, the most convoluted one being direct nbt edit from server files. And that player is free from not playing on the officials, if he doesn't trust the team."

**Describe the bug**
<!--
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
-->
When using an OpenVPN connection (I suspect it is the same on WireGuard, but I have not tried that as I do not have access to a WireGuard VPN as of now) on a qBitTorrent app hostPath mounts are not mounted properly (also tried PVC, that didn't work either). The connection works (the logs show the VPN IP, not my IP), and adding and downloading torrents works, it just doesn't download them to my torrent dataset, making them inaccessible. This exact same configuration with VPN disabled works as intended, just without the VPN.
**To Reproduce**
<!--

3. Configure a valid OpenVPN connection
4. Configure the app so it should function (proper ports, etc.)
5. Start this app
6. To observe: open shell for the qBitTorrent container (not the OpenVPN container, although nothing appears there either). The hostPath/PVC mount will not be mounted.

**Describe the bug**
I'm building a small game that uses some primitive shapes for things.
Whenever I use a PolyhedronGeometry (like DodecahedronGeometry or IcosahedronGeometry) in an instancedMesh, my GPU tanks to ~5FPS (depending on the amount of instances).
I've spent hours figuring out what is happening and yesterday it looked like `powerPreference: 'high-performance'` was the issue (disabling solved the issue), but today it's back again with the same issues.
So this might not be threejs directly, but rather a webgl problem?
it's very hard to reproduce, because in FireFox this doesn't happen, only in Chrome, on my 2016 MacBook pro, so I feel like it might even be the webgl implementation of Chrome itself.
Interestingly enough FPS are just fine with other geometries (like box, or cone, etc), just not any of the PolyhedronGeometry based ones.
**To Reproduce**
You can clone my repo (https://github.com/TheDutchCoder/atc-gjk) and on the `convert-to-native-js` branch you can run `npm run dev`.
If you see good FPS, please let me know which browser and OS you're using, because again I feel like this might even be a browser problem.
Disclaimer: code is a bit of a mess currently because I'm moving things around and trying to fix this issue.
***Code***

**Expected behavior**
When using a PolyhedronGeometry I should not see a huge drop in FPS.

4428,1137624289,1039933110,None,I never paid attention to the possibility to assign a scope to a setting. What you suggest sounds reasonable. I guess other settings should also have a `resource` scope. We should try to make a list.

and to be honest, I had a hard time finding settings which should remain `window`-scoped. (I always wonder why that is the default - probably historic reasons). Everything related to editing or compiling a specific file (editor settings, syntax, tools, etc.) should be `resource`-scope IMHO.
The ones I found that *may* not be correct to scope by `resource` are the ones that may not be uniquely tied to a single document, such as everything related to (pre-)loading and configuring extensions used by multiple documents:

This implies that only a single instance of an extension can run inside a window. Some settings require to reload the window after change typically because they are used in constructors (theirs values are fixed in the instance). All these settings must not have the `resource` scope. This is probably why the default scope is `window`.
Hence, making the list of settings that could have the `resource` scope is not so simple. All this requires a lot of care to avoid introducing very tricky bugs."

4434,1137624289,1044122554,None,"> I believe everything related to `intellisense`, `hover`, `kpsewhich`, `message` and `view` should not be changed.
I wonder why that is. Is that motivated by the required implementation effort, or by your opinion that these should not be configurable by `resource` from a use-case perspective? As far as I have understood settings scopes, changing a `window`-scoped setting to a `resource`-scoped setting will not break anything at all for existing users - it will only open additional possibilities to move a setting into a resource-specific location. If the latter, I wonder what the motivation is to prevent users from, for example, using different `latex-workshop.intellisense.file.exclude` patterns for different documents, or from adapting `latex-workshop.intellisense.update.delay` for each document to account for different document sizes and thus processing times (just two examples, I might be able to think of more)."
4435,1137624289,1044166295,None,I agree the list is reasonable. We can discuss further on a pull request. We might have to keep some of them window-scoped due to the implementation difficulty.

You mention `latex-workshop.intellisense.update.delay`, which was not in my fisrt and `latex-workshop.intellisense.file.exclude`, which I kept in the second one.
Because of the need to access the document `uri`, some of these properties may still be removed from the second list.

You visited the wiki?: Yes
### If your requested feature is with compiling a document (not having to do with finding the root file of a project), check first that you can compile manually.
You can compile a TeX document manually?: Yes
## Is your requested feature related to a problem? Please describe. [Required]
I have two docs in a structure like this:
```
D:\BUG
│ bug.code-workspace
│
├───doc1
│ └───.vscode
│ settings.json
│
└───doc2
```
I open both docs in one VS Code window. This is what `bug.code-workspace` is for.
In `doc1`, I would like to set a few settings that I do not want to apply to `doc2`. This is what `doc1/.vscode/settings.json` is for, and it looks like this:
```json
{
""editor.wordWrapColumn"": 88,
""latex-workshop.latexindent.args"": [
""-c"",
""%DIR%/"",
""%TMPFILE%"",
""-y=defaultIndent: '%INDENT%'"",
""-l"",
],
}
```
So far, so good. However, this is not working because `latex-workshop.latexindent.args` is window-scoped, while `editor.wordWrapColumn` is resource-scoped. In line with that, the setting is greyed out and not applied:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12128514/153915001-83c233fe-c102-4f57-b00d-16e5d49028fb.png)
The reason is that the setting is not properly scoped - it has `window` scope:
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/6136c815bc6e7b99ec2dac56dccb3869574d2dd8/src/vs/workbench/contrib/preferences/browser/preferencesRenderers.ts#L596-L603
And the reason for that is that it does not have an explicit scope at all, so it falls back to `window` - see https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points:
https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/blob/04f73108e439661faef2c8f85eac7baacbdb736b/package.json#L1810-L1822
This is certainly not intentional - I see no reason for this setting to (necessarily) be the same for all resources in a window. It should be able to differ by resource (folder).
## Describe the solution you'd like [Required]
The fix is simple: set the scope for `latex-workshop.latexindent.args` (and probably other settings as well) to `resource`. Happy to provide a PR if that helps."

When people read the documentation first, they are confused by the lack of a common naming structure and input/output type structure.
That should be cleaned and reorganized so that when people are working and reading the 1000's of Go functions (certainly impossible to remember all) they will not get frustrated by constant flipping between string and []byte and a lack of a naming structure that can be quickly remembered because it adheres to both common function names per functionality and input/output type."

I didn't read every function, but you should and you should adhere this naming structure and ensure that all relevant sets exist.
In other words
`Encode([]byte)` means there should be `Decode([]byte)`
`function_1_group_with_3_total()` should include `function_2_group_with_3_total()` and `function_3_group_with_3_total()` and so on. For example, with hash functions there is usually a standard naming format due to the required functions, that of `input`, `parse`, `decode`, `inputMore` etc.
Then when someone is working for example with the encoding/base64 library, they can set a number of days or hours aside to work with the library then get used to the functions.

### Bug Description
ViaVersion's spigot injector decides to wrap minecraft's vanilla encoder. I'm trying to make my own injector. I want to process buffers, that aren't translated by ViaVersion yet. It would be better if ViaVersion had a separate outgoing handler which were called after the vanilla minecraft encoder. Your handler can expect bytebufs and just translate them like that. Let the vanilla encoder do its job by translating NMS packets to bytebufs for you to process. This would make it so easy for any other packet plugin to just get in between ViaVersion and the vanilla encoder.
Similarly can be said about the decoder. You guys just wrap the minecraft vanilla decoder... I want to process packets right after ViaVersion translates incoming bytebufs. You could simply put ViaVersion's decoder infront of vanilla's decoder. Then I can just get inbetween and process my bytebufs there. ViaVersion isn't the only packet plugin out there, and I've also seen other developers finding making an injector a struggle. I managed to get a ""working"" decoder, but its really really not great and doesn't work great if you can't predict how many packet projects are running on the server. You'd also be saving yourself redundant reflection calls to vanilla handlers?
Additionally with what ProtocolLib does, calling ""encoder"" right after it processes the first NMS object... that just doesn't make making an injector easier.
I just want to know, is there a reason you did not do this? Seems like it would just be easier to handle things like that, worst case scenario if you guys don't want to fix your injector, I could do it.
### Steps to Reproduce
Check bug description
### Expected Behavior
ViaVersion has separate handlers (their own encoder and decoder) on Spigot. Right now they wrap the vanilla ones, and it makes it difficult to get inbetween. Especially if you aren't assuming how many pipeline injecting projects will be running on a server. ### Additional Server Info

### If your issue is with compiling a document (not having to do with finding the root file of a project), check first that you can compile manually.
You can compile a TeX document manually?: Yes
## Describe the bug [Required]
A clear and concise description of what the bug is
When I switch the format into `TeX` or `LaTeX-expl3`, there is no button of `View LaTeX PDF File`. ### To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Open a `.tex` file
2. Compile it with `-synctex=1` option
3. switch the format between `LaTeX` and `LaTeX-expl3` and see difference. ### Expected behavior

4509,1159293958,1159293958,Bitter frustration,"### Summary
I see 404s in your docs - it looks like somebody **removed** URLs to important doc entries like e.g. http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html
but then **did not introduce a redirect** from the old doc entry to some new one, so that people are seeing 404s.
This is a very bad documentation practice and should never be done in any project. Yes, **REDIRECTS** exist for exactly this purpose. For an important infrastructure project it is expected that documentation writers understand these concepts. The underlying issue here is not just a simple 404 - it seems like the documentation writing person is not informed about the existence of redirects and believes that it is OK to just remove URLs from the internet - this should be made clear on day one for anybody doing this kind of work: it is NOT!
Also we see here a complete lack of understanding and empathy for the readers situation, what is another very important skill for documentation writers that must be required for such a job position. The person who introduced this problem did not think for one second about how annoying and disctracting it is to find a broken URL while the reader is trying to figure out some technical details. This all can be fixed on a technical level with simple redirects - but it needs to be fixed on a human level, the person who did this needs to learn about the importance of respecting the reading experience, this is of course true for the project manager. This is not acceptable for such a top level project.

https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/blob/a93d2970a3694e683588fedaa0f8a901fe148d3b/WordPress-Extra/ruleset.xml#L130-L139
There is already an issue open to discuss this: https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards/issues/1884 Might be good to have a look through that and leave an opinion ?"

$this->classname_tokens[ \T_OPEN_CURLY_BRACKET ] = \T_OPEN_CURLY_BRACKET;
$this->classname_tokens[ \T_CLOSE_CURLY_BRACKET ] = \T_CLOSE_CURLY_BRACKET;
```
To the list of classname tokens and ran the phpcbf and got the correct result 😅 Note that I didn't run the tests or anything so this could be a one off fix that breaks other things, so...
EDIT: Added a test and it breaks anonymous classes:
```
-$util->setLogger( new class() {} );
+$util->setLogger( new class {}() );
```
So, not really a fix."

4566,1170768726,1170768726,None,"## Bug Description
The fixer for the missing parentheses sniff adds the parentheses to the wrong place for a particular statement.
## Minimal Code Snippet
```php
$this->current_provider = new $this->providers->{$this->current_provider_slug}['provider'];
```
The issue happens when running this command:
```bash
phpcs phpcs-test.php --standard=WordPress-Extra -sp --basepath=.
```
... over a file containing this code (minimal example, extracted from the real code):
```php
<?php
$this->current_provider = new $this->providers->{$this->current_provider_slug}['provider'];
```
<!-- For bugs with fixers: How was the code fixed? How did you expect the code to be fixed? -->
The file was auto-fixed via `phpcbf` to:
```php
<?php
$this->current_provider = new $this->providers->(){$this->current_provider_slug}['provider'];
// ---------------------------------------------^ ❌ ```
... while I expected the code to be fixed to:
```php
<?php
$this->current_provider = new $this->providers->{$this->current_provider_slug}['provider']();
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------^ ✅ ```
## Error Code

### Describe the bug
The bridge doesn't come up. Logs show it fails to initialize.
When opening a shell in the container, and lauch the command ""protonmail-bridge --cli"" I get the following error :
WARN[0000] Failed to add test credentials to keychain error=""pass not initialized: exit status 1: Error: password store is empty. Try \""pass init\"".\n"" helper=""*pass.Pass""
After using the command ""pass init protonmail"" to initialize de password manager, I get the following error : WARN[0000] Failed to add test credentials to keychain error=""exit status 1: gpg: protonmail: skipped: No public key\ngpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: No public key\nPassword encryption aborted.\n"" helper=""*pass.Pass""
After initializing a gpg key (without password and all default settings), following [this issue](https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/190), I was able to make it work.
### To Reproduce
- Install protonmail-bridge
- bug occur
### Expected Behavior
Protonmail bridge should be up and accepting connexion.
### Screenshots

I can confirm this happens for both variants of the multi-line comment (one or two asterisks):
- One asterisk
```
/*
* Some comment.
*/
```
- Two asterisks
```
/**
* Some comment.
*/
```
It does **NOT** happen for:
- One asterisk in one line
```
/* Some comment. */
```
- Two asterisks in one line
```
/** Some comment. */
```
- Normal comment over multiple lines
```
// Some
// Comment ```
### To Reproduce
Reproduction repo:
https://github.com/bennettdams/nextjs-render-comment-bug
..or to manually reproduce:
1. ` npx create-next-app@12.1.2-canary.0 --ts --use-npm .`
2. Install canary `npm i next@12.1.2-canary.0`
3. Add a multi-line comment to start of the render function of `index.tsx` directly after `return`:
```tsx
const Home: NextPage = () => {
return (
/**
* Some comment.
*/
<div className={styles.container}>
<Head>
...
```
4. `npm run dev` or `npm run build`"

I'm not sure why the website cannot be accessed in Belarus. It has nothing to do with us adding the banner as requested in #1961. That simply put a message on our GitHub `README` files. It didn't do anything to change who can access the website.
The block could be happening at multiple layers of our infrastructure, not all of which I have immediate access to. We'll investigate and let you know.

I guess I found the reason. I found PR about Ukraine support. So, my guess it was done on purpose.
Personally, I'm against any war as anyone on a planet. However, I feel excluding me from usage of cucumber website as a form of racism. Especially it looks ugly for entire Belarus.
Can you comment on that?
Apart from that I'm a little bit puzzled. I wrote some time ago cucumber extension for VS code to format feature files. Since i'm not of a good race to use cucumber website, is it ok to have it still published?
And one more question, the company I'm working for is using cucumber. And I don't know what to do since I really like cucumber, but racism inside company is prohibited and should I schedule meeting about alternatives.

4636,1190959350,1190959350,None,"I have over 30 years working in the Wireless Industry. I would like to propose a long term structure that will align Helium with how real world wireless networks are designed and operated. I am proposing to initiate planning for ""HIP 100"" which would restructure the Helium network approach to align with the fundamentals of wireless networks which:
1. Provide consistent reliable COVERAGE.
2. Provide the highest QUALITY which consists of MAXIMIZING signal levels (RSRP) while MINIMIZING interference levels (SINR).
3. Provide the best user PERFORMANCE at the LOWEST cost which consists of CAPACITY planning based on SUBSCRIBER density and locations
4. Have a robust END-TO-END architecture which balances the CORE network, the RADIO network and the END-USER device performance.
5. Provides accurate LOCATION information about BOTH the Hotspot and the Devices. All modern networks today have GPS built into both the Cell Tower and the devices. LOCATION is fundamental to securing the network as well as optimizing the network and device performance.
Even though the current Helium network is a major advance towards distributed ownership and control, the current construct is not aligned with the fundamentals of Wireless design. For example:
1. To build a network, there needs to be a reward system for BOTH the HOTSPOT and the DEVICE. Until the network is built and device performance is validated, there should be rewards for buying and deploying DEVICES to to test and validate coverage. Validating coverage using HOTSPOT to HOTSPOT beacons is fundamentally flawed. This is NOT how wireless works. Base stations try to AVOID seeing each other to minimize interference.
2. The current reward system motivates hotspot owners to place their hotspot at the highest point possible so they can witness the most number of other hotspots. This results in drastically increasing SINR which is opposite of how wireless should be designed. You want to MINIMIZE SINR, because that is the fundamental of Cellular, so that the same frequencies can be reused and the CAPACITY and QUALITY can be maximized.
3. The current reward system favors hotspots that are in less populated areas and penalizes hotspots in dense areas. This is also opposite of the fundamentals of wireless. You need MORE hotspots in dense areas.
4. The current implementations of Beaconing is flawed as well. Wireless networks beacon 100% of the time. This maximizes the CAPACITY and ensures that the network performance STATISTICS are consistently reported to allow proper monitoring and optimization.
5. The current implementation does not have accurate LOCATION of the hotspots nor the DEVICES. In fact there are so few DEVICES that there is no DEVICE performance information. LOCATION is not difficult, using a combination of GPS at key Hotspots, Triangulation algorithms and WiFi to accurately and securely locate all Hotspots and devices in the Network. Without accurate LOCATION information, the network will never be secure nor will we be able to deploy a QUALITY, HIGH PERFORMANCE network.
Understand, that I am not proposing to ""throw the Baby out with the Bath Water"". Nor am I criticizing the objective of Helium to build a decentralized, ownership model. But we want to build a network that will actually deliver a service that is of value to a subscriber base of wireless devices. It is paramount that we begin this journey towards a working Wireless construct or else we may find ourselves in this predicament: ""IF YOU BUILD IT - IT WILL NOT WORK"" rather than what we want which is ""IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME"""

On the first slide the accent color looks kinda red and not the actual orange brand color, are you sure you used the right code? If it is the right color code then perhaps on that particular background we could lighten the orange just a bit.
Listen I very much appreciate your feedback here but I have to mention that as a person that has poor sight, I would argue that it's imperative the background to be kept at least a bit darker than your proposed hex above and the active link to be of an accent color (instead of a base like white) so it easily distinguishable and not on the same hue as the inactive links (truly important).
Check this =>
https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html

We want to grow as a framework and as a user base but Vue.js is killing us with those Docs comparing to Svelte/kit's.
Please choose a slight darker background color, just a tiny touch and keep a punchy accent color close to the logo for the active links, I am positive this will help grow the framework, it sounds crazy but it is in my experience an important detail really.
Between choosing competing stuff online I personally have chosen then ones with the more accessible documentation.

Hey @savannahx, thanks for your reply here.
I am not sure if there is unawareness or selfishness involved on your reply.
To be honest it feels there was unawareness and selfishness involved in your message because of the way you formulated yourself and did not think about us, the other 99% of svelte-kit users, who also have to deal with this change and asked of us to actually do all the work of implementing this new color.
You provided no way for us to reach a middle ground where both you and others can be happy. It seems like you really just want us to change the color to what you want.

If you are still unable to read the documentation - which is also available on Github, which has a very great accessibility - you might want to buy a new monitor, open or close your blinds, change your color profile, tweak the brightness, gamma, contrast and other settings, increase the scale of your UI or install a extension which can do automatic contrast for you. Again, this is a problem only we deal with. We are an edge case."

I am too old for this. it's okay, I am not perfect either, nobody is. Anyway I really hope this gets addressed if anyone has access and time to implement this color edit (removing the washed out blueish background and using an accent color for the active link).
I would create a pull request but I barely know Svelte so apologies for not taking the initiative in that regard.
@benmccann feel free to let me know if and when I should close this Issue and thanks again for your consideration."
4647,1201906086,1098078770,None,"alright, time out. i locked the conversation.
accessibility matters to us and we want to get this right. people shouldn't have to fiddle with browser settings just to read documentation. at the same time, there's a balance to be struck between maximising contrast and making the site pleasant to look at for people without visual impairments and/or shitty screens (we could just use pure black on pure white or vice versa everywhere, but that would be very tiring for most people to look at for any length of time).
so we will address this, though i make no guarantees about where it sits in the priority queue, and putting 'asap' in the issue title or declaring that the current contrast ratio means 'i cannot use SvelteKit without it' (unlikely) won't affect that decision (though there is now a pull request for it pending review — https://github.com/sveltejs/sites/pull/327)"
4648,1201906086,1201906086,None,"### Describe the problem
Hello ladies and gents.
I am fairly new to Svelte/Sveltekit but I would like to make a suggestion please.
It is regarding documentation...
Can somebody change the background color of the sidebar from this difficult color #676778; to something darker?
Literally every time you want to focus on a link on the sidebar your eyes hurt and you lose at least 1 to 2 seconds until you focus on what you want to find and all that because poor contrast.
Also the ""highlighted"" link (the active one) is, honestly, almost indistinguishable from the inactive links below and above, why is this? Why not make it something like almost black background with white inactive links and the active link like the orange color from the logo? Perhaps put a divider line in between links or something?
By the way, I do these things every time I use the docs, this is how bad it is, no offense to anyone, but 1-2 seconds of faster focus per person per time they visit the docs, well, we want to be talking about performance when we are talking about Svelte right? Please do the right thing, the nice svelte logo orange color matches great with a darker blackish background color, why put that ugly blueish/purplish (which is not dark enough for a bg color)?
To whoever can make this happen, PLEASE we need docs that can be scanned quickly. Here is the contrast score https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/ffffff-676778
It's almost poor... if you have any sort of sight issues... I mean come on, how come no one addressed this before, docs is a huge part of the process.
### Describe the proposed solution
Color for the ""active"" link => #ff3e00
Color for the sidebar background => #242426
Any dark enough background (with no colors, either blackish or grayish/blackish will do) ### Alternatives considered
Please adjust this so visually impaired or people with sight difficulties (even the ones with glasses) can focus easier on the links and traverse faster. ### Importance
i cannot use SvelteKit without it
### Additional Information
Every time I browse the docs I literally go to inspect and change these myself....!
Thanks for your understanding!"

If I was smart enough to do that I would've already done that 🥴 ...
someone did help me to native compile the mesa library and I think it worked probably ... but no way to test it ...
can you give me a test program to check wheather OpenGL works or not ?

just go to Termux-Faint-Hope repo and copy the patches folder in /sdcard/ and run the myScripts/build-zink.sh or myScripts/build-mesa.sh"

@xeffyr @suhan-paradkar I just killed two birds with one stone
### 1 - OpenGL crash in 32 bits arm devices **How to fix it?**
- Enable opengl in mesa, vulkan drivers and galium drivers. - I haven't tried zink, but you don't need to enable zink - Add wayland, libsha1 mesa-gl, mesa-dri packages - Enable opengl in libepoxy package - Enable opengl, Xephyr, dri1 dri2 dri3, in xorg-xserver And voila!, everything will work smoothly in both Xwayland and vnc. ### 2 - How to fix gl4es is slow Just follow the steps in step 1, and voila, gl4es will go fast and smooth. ### Additional Notes Do not use ndk-multilib for compilation, leave OpenGL broken for compilation of more packages in the future It works perfectly, I don't get segmentation failures and the optimization is excellent, I don't know if this works also in 64 bits. The slowness of gl4es must be because the graphics are forced, since mesa does not provide a correct rendering, I think that explains why gl4es is slow I was guided by this page : https://gxmersam.blogspot.com/p/getting-hardware-acceleration-on-termux.html?m=1
And I go back and repeat, I'm not using zink, you don't need zink to work. I hope you find all this information useful"

I don't think we have any completely removed props. Some may have been combined to be more intuitive, but they are there.

If you rely on some of the components that aren't going to be in 3.0, I see two choices:
1. you wait until the release that contains all of the components you use
2. you replace the missing components with components you build

I see that you don't understand, but the point is if you start a new project, you DON'T want to start it in v.2.x and then to migrate it all to v.3.x. Take in mind that it is not only vuetify 3, but you are by being forced to use vuetify 2, forced to use vue 2 too! So it is pretty pretty painful enforcement!
Thus, developers and PMs are ""enforced"" and motivated to do additional work and workarounds etc to enable v.3 version working, then to have the enormous work later in migrating whole the project.

4794,1213461044,1144691573,Bitter frustration,"Hmm, I was trying to keep bearing with Vuetify 3 (even implementing some workarounds on our ongoing projects) until target release is here.
Yet:
- official deadline for Vuetify Target release has passed (May) but we're still in Beta
- there are no answers from developers regarding not-working functionality even the one documented in Beta as working https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/discussions/15054
- we do not get updates when something is going to be delivered, after the self-defined deadlined has passed, so we can hardly make valid decisions
- as some of you mentioned here, it seems that the TARGET release of 3.0 (expected in the passed May) won't be a ""real"" target release in sense it will still lack too many components of their functionality, compared to 2.x version ...
- I would like to hear some opposing reassuring thoughts from developers, yet it seems that the waiting and workarounds inspired by ""too optimistic"" announcements by Vuetify developers is not justified anymore :(
- Especially that this is not ony waiting for Vuetify 3 but also preventing us from switching from Vue2 to Vue 3 and all the new ecosystem being built around it (so waiting on 2.7 and suggested (automatic) migration to 3.x using it is neither solution, esp. that it has also been prolonged for several months)
In another thread https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/discussions/14776 the [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) is mentioned as an alternative while we wait for the Vuetify 3 reaching that level of stability and versatility. I guess I will give it a try.
P.S. Dear @MartinX3 please keep it civil, multiple developers here get ""attacked"" by you for having different opinions. It's ok to have different opinions even calls for action, and by aggressive reactions to someones opinions we even get stronger reactions and fortify them in the opinions we might not like :) Best wishes to Vuetify team and keep your good work, we all, by being developers, know how it is to work under pressure and we should have empathy.
On the other side we also have our own dependent projects and our clients/bosses above our heads, and it would help both us and you I guess to be more transparent and objective regarding releases so that we can make our decisions on time and to avoid disappointments.
**The main info missing and being misleading as I see by reading community questions** is **on which date approximately or which release** we should expect that we have let's say **90% of the components/functionality provided in 2.x versions**

Regarding DOCS, I'm not telling that the Docs are not updated.
On the contrary! The [v.3.0 docs for `v-select`](https://next.vuetifyjs.com/en/api/v-select/#props-items) state that `props-item` are working as expected.
Yet as I and other devs have stated, read [more here in the explained issue](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/discussions/15054) - that's not the fact. I myself tried to test it even beyond docs in different ways..
The problem here is that we lose the point of reference/truth, on what can we rely in the current `beta.1` and the following versions of Vuetify?
Or you're trying to say that the docs DOES NOT reflect the currently released version and is written independently to reflect the final (desired) v.3.0?
If it does reflect, could anyone investigate that issue of v-select. As being one of the central UX components and not working as documented, I feel we are pushed for alternatives.

- I was not trying any v2 example but was trying to make v3 v-select to work according to v3 [component doc](https://next.vuetifyjs.com/en/components/selects/), abd [api doc](https://next.vuetifyjs.com/en/api/v-select/#props-items).
- `item-title` prop is not documented, but **item-text, item-value and item-disabled** props. Nevertheless, neither is solving this issue.

- So, after trying all possible and impossible variants to handle `v-select` supporting objects instead of simple text, I can confirm it's not working. ANd as I've said, you have other dev(s) claiming the same.
- and that is not some advanced functionality, but needed for almost any app.
- if we accept that there is some Docs misbehaviour, the point is still: What is our point of reference then, when we use components and their props? or even for community-testing of the Beta versions to give you any feedback?"

@sinisarudan Vuetify 3 is beta, which usually means:
- Development has priority over authoring docs right now. - Errata, and missing information is to be expected in the docs while in beta up until V3 reaches some unspecified level of maturity.
- The development team has no obligation to provide API guarantees until GA.
- The scope of the V3 initial release is locked in, what you see on the release checklist is meant to give you an idea how close/far they are to release.
- I have my own questions about V3 but I know that it would be inappropriate to ask them HOW to do something with V3 Beta, and more appropriate to ask them if a specific feature, or component will be included in the initial release (excluding anything that they may consider obvious)
- The dev team is free to ignore discussions or bug reports until V3 is released. They are more likely to interact with you if you intend to contribute code or if you engage with them on something that team members are currently concerned with or occupied with.
I specifically posted to this task, because I wanted to know about a feature. I didn't get a response, and it's no big deal for me right now. I have other things to worry about.
TLDR: Don't expect any kind of support from the dev team for non GA releases. They're still making V3 and will more likely converse with you as long as the discussion has to do with any of their present concerns."

It just happened to work given the similarities with MySQL, but we optimize and test for MySQL 5 and 8.

Unfortunately there are some environments where MySQL is not supported ([Archlinux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MySQL) for example) and we _have_ to use MariaDB. MariaDB is supposed to be a drop-in replacement of MySQL so everything should work as expected (and was working until `v4.46`).

Update: mysql-8.0 is neither available in Debian stable repositories, nor testing repos (but in sid for now). Installing mysql-8.0 from Oracle (who I trust less than Debian packagers) break dependencies with packages relying on MariaDB 10, the default-mysql-server in Debian. So, because of a single migration, one of the biggest distros cannot be used to host a Ghost blog. This is madness."

The only explanation is that commercial version of Ghost runs on MySQL and they care just about that. We as users of open source Ghost are not important for them, we don't pay.
Why PostgreSQL is dropped some years ago if Ghost uses [knex](https://github.com/knex/knex), which supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, CockroachDB, MSSQL, SQLite3 and Oracle? And now they drop MariaDB which is the default MySQL flavor at all major Linux distributions. It seems it's time to drop Ghost, I won't use it anymore."

4844,1221806426,1121189409,Bitter frustration,"Hey all 👋, I've locked this bug to contributor comments only. It's caused by an [upstream bug in knex](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues/5154). When a fix is pushed into knex, Ghost's renovate setup will automatically pull it into Ghost, meaning it will be included in the subsequent release. If anyone needs or wants some support with migrating from MariaDB to MySQL, please use the [forum](https://forum.ghost.org/).
I understand there's a lot of frustration around the clarification that MariaDB is not an officially supported database. As a small team we've always provided a very narrow set of environments that are officially supported to keep our maintenance overhead manageable: Ghost is intended for use with Ubuntu, MySQL, nginx & Node.js LTS. We're not able to support every flavour of environment without differences being handled correctly in the upstream packages. The way to change what's supported would be to contribute the necessary fixes & improvements - we'd absolutely love to see more contributions around database interoperability in [knex](https://github.com/knex/knex/issues)."

As mentioned in the doc update this isn't possible with this patch. I initially started out with a `parent:` prefix (e.g. `parent:attr=value`) to be able to more precisely specify which attributes should be lifted to the parent, but decided against it as it needed quite more code changes. Plus I wonder how many times you would really want to be able to set attributes on both list items and the list itself. For the latter you only need to use an attribute on a single list item, while all the other list items can still have their own attributes."
4849,1227174892,1119113841,None,An alternative could be to have a single ^ as a marker in the attribute list to indicate that all attributes following it should be set on the parent. That would allow both list and table attributes with minimal code changes.
4850,1227174892,1119329307,None,I updated the pull request to use `^` as a marker to signal when attributes should be lifted. Solves the issue of not being to define both list element attributes and parent attributes in the same attribute definition

I have seen a number of similar comments about not wanting to implement it, but I'm really struggling to understand why? This feature is currently not available, yet is obviously valuable to many, given all the requests over the many *years* it has shown up as an issue here. The way I implement it here does not seem to interfere with any existing feature, as far as I can tell. And if the special `^` marker isn't used at all then there's no difference in behaviour, so it should be fully backwards compatible.

4898,1242792738,1134557192,None,"Okay @ashish-jaiswar , Let my PR be reviewed. Sounds good now?"
4899,1242792738,1134561440,Threat,"hey @NitishKumar06, kubernetes community will not accept your PR. Because you are working against the policy of kubernetes."
4900,1242792738,1134563752,None,@ashish-jaiswar My last PR was not merged because although I was working on this issue as well but someone after me started working on it and his PR got merged.
4901,1242792738,1134575413,None,"_I'm writing this as a [tech lead](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/49ecc500205884984a2174422f7715e7f9556b28/sig-docs#leadership) for SIG Docs_
:white_circle: **TL;DR;** calm it down and be excellent to each other. :white_circle: Folks, it's best if people co-ordinate work. **_Anyone_** is welcome to open a PR to work on an issue provided they sign the CLA and agree to abide by our [code of conduct](https://kubernetes.io/community/code-of-conduct/).
If reviewers see multiple PRs opened for the same issue, they will usually:
- sigh inwardly
- look at the PR that was opened first, see if it's good to merge, and if so, merge that
- if not, look at the other PRs in chronological order
and finally
- close the other PRs with an explanation
So there's three further things here as I see it:
1. https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/33848#issuecomment-1134518812 mentions that
> you can't work on this issue if someone is already working . this is against the policy of kubernetes.
I'm afraid that's not true. For SIG Docs, we actually have a policy of no [cookie licking](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/dont-lick-cookie): nobody should assert that they own the implementation of an issue. 1. However, it's unhelpful to work on an issue where someone else has started work, without first discussing with that person how to move forward. The polite and compassionate thing to do if someone has said they're working on an issue, but you don't see progress after a week or so is to get in touch and ask if they would like help. If they step back or you don't hear anything at all, you remain welcome to open your own PR.
- https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/33848#issuecomment-1134446220
- https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/33848#issuecomment-1134539047
are both examples of behavior I'd prefer not to see more of.
1. It's best if people who have already worked on an issue avoid picking up Good First Issue issues. This issue is _not_ a “good first issue”; I deliberately chose not to add the Good First Issue label because I left the implementer some work to do around writing the hyperlink text and deciding what message would be suitable.
That means it is OK for someone who has already submitted a PR to work on this. However, I would encourage people who are already contributing to hold off on Help Wanted issues (this one included) and only start work on a Help Wanted issue if you don't see any other work that you can reasonably pick up.
This discussion is getting more heated than it should be. If folks want to discuss how SIG Docs works, take it to Slack (https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-docs - invitations available from https://slack.k8s.io/) or come to the community meeting, 5:30 AM UTC on Wednesday 2022-05-25. A Zoom link for that call is in the Slack channel.
GitHub issues are not the place for [ad hominem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem) criticisms etc and I hope all concerned will take that on board.
I don't see grounds to involve the code of conduct folks at this point, and I'm hoping things stay that way. @ashish-jaiswar if you do have a concern about someone not following the code of conduct, please raise that by following the documented process.
_PS_ I edited this a few times for accuracy; sorry about the noise from updates."

For your convenience, I've assembled it as a zsh function alias. You can put it in your .aliases or .bashrc or .zshrc or just take any part of it as you like. This is simply the solution from @politsin wrapped with a configuration variable that chooses herd, homebrew or any other service you are serving from to place your updated composer. Cheers 🍻 ```zsh
composer:purge-politics() {
# the keyword local destructs the memory variables so they wont stick around
# after your function closes to interfere with any other system settings
# which server are you going to run herd or something else (homebrew, xamp)
local server=""herd""
local composer_path
# choose the appropriate path for composer
[[ $server == ""herd"" ]] && composer_path=""/Users/<your home directory>/Library/Application Support/Herd/bin/composer"" || composer_path=""/usr/local/bin/composer""
# ** note change <your home directory>

Acting like a child: using an international it-project for political propaganda and demonstration of absolute misunderstanding of the situation.
It's been 2 years and it's already clear to everyone that Ukraine is just a way to launder money for US military corporations, and the composer is a dying project that should be gradually removed from their projects."

Your logic is flawed. Readme is not version information. Sometimes projects include version information in readme, but many times they do not.
I did not even scroll down.

To prevent time wasted on using wrong version. I only noticed it after palette->version was missing.
60 minutes of time wasted, I consider myself lucky.
99.9% of the people on this planet suck at proper versioning, including file systems.

5026,1291899006,1172793466,None,"It's true this was one of the more controversial notice/warning promotions for 8.0, however a majority of the 63 people voting on the matter felt that the promotion was worthwhile. Going back on that decision now would be counter-productive.
https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings
Note that you can still use the `@` operator in PHP 8.
https://3v4l.org/P9Otd
Because the truth is that PHP cannot know whether code accessing an undefined array key is doing so out of negligence or laziness (no offense). Perhaps the author assumed that `$_GET['xxx']` existed when they wrote it and the warning is pointing out a real potential problem. Perhaps it was done out of a desire to type less and the warning is a nuisance reminder of that fact. Only you as a human being can know, so PHP takes the more cautious approach of assuming the worst."
5027,1291899006,1172800261,Impatience,"Thanks for your comment. I can understand the reason for changing it, but PHP is normally exceptional because it is so good at backward-compatibility and type-juggling. As the author of the codebases concerned, I've relied intentionally on that designed, documented, and intuitive behaviour of PHP in everything I've written for 20 years, since PHP4. I've always assumed that associative arrays can have variable numbers of keys (including zero).
So, it would cost me a 1000 hours of needless effort to find and change and test and QA and git every instance, and the codebase would be harder to read for it afterwards.
So at the moment, I've got 4 options, all bad.
* permanently stay on PHP7x
* permanently disable warnings
* fork PHP and maintain a patch
* incur months of busy-work.
I'm sure I'm not the only one this would affect.
So, that's why I'm suggesting a config option to change this, so that we can have it both ways."
5028,1291899006,1172800337,Vulgarity,"Not recommended, because it will bite you in the ass, but you can set error handler to filter that warning:

For others who come across this problem, here is a more complete way of doing this, which preserves the error message, but demotes it back to a notice.

set_error_handler(function($errno, $error){
if (!str_starts_with($error, 'Undefined array key')){
return false; //default error handler.

The voting was wrong. Even when 51% prefer to mess up their code, it's not fair nor necessary to force the rest of us to do the same. We have read all your reasons, but we are still pretty sure you are wrong.
There are many brilliant developers who love PHP because you can write things as easy as:
```
if($arr['user']['name']) {
}
```
It's perfectly ok to assume that an undefined key and any sub-element will return NULL or any other value that casts to FALSE without throwing a WARNING. If we would care about the value, we would explicitly use isset().
We are not afraid about misspelling a key name. It was never a problem for us, but your decission infuriates us.
We have been sitting on old PHP versions for years because we refuse to sacrifice PHP's original simplicity.
Otherwise, we would probably be coding in C# / .NET

If you put the code-block below into one of your common header files, you'll get what you want, i.e. demoting the warning back to a notice.

You can adapt the code to handle other unwanted errors, such as 'Undefined variable' depending on how far you want to take this. ```

Yes, that's what we all are doing, but the big problem are the exceptions when accessing undefined variables."
5033,1291899006,1291899006,None,"### Description
In PHP 7, underfined array keys created E_NOTICE. This is now E_WARNING.
Can we please have a configuration option to put that back to E_NOTICE?
Rightly or wrongly, there are a lot of people, myself included, who have thousands of lines of code with things such as:
``` if ($_GET['xxx']) ``` #where xxx may or may not exist.
or
```if ($_GET['xxx'] == 'yyy')```
and in PHP8, we now get flooded with warnings ""Undefined array key"", which get in the way of real warnings.
Migrating and testing this code will take a long time, and furthermore, it's really ugly and harder to read:
```if (isset($_GET['xxx'))```
or
```if (isset($_GET['xxx']) && $_GET['xxx'] == 'yyy'))```
to suppress this warning.
Instead, it would be better to have some sort of pragma in the main header ```ini_set(""array_key_missing_enotice"", true);```
```ini_set (""error_reporting"", E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE);```
To me, it seems sensible that a defined associative array, with a key that isn't present (and may not be expected), should not be a warning, especially if it's being tested for with if().
It may also be worth treating undefined variables the same way.
Thanks for your help,"

Yeah. We all feel your dissapointment. Some developers here didn't appreciate PHP's simplicity and took a very bad decission.
As @RichardNeill pointed out above, you should write your own `error_reporting` callback and do some minor modifications.
For instance, we had cases of `count(NULL)` throwing fatal errors, so we had to create a function to force conversion from NULLs to arrays.
Let's hope backwards compatibily will be respected in next versions."
5036,1291899006,1304131485,None,"What is the performance like with suppressed error messages? I once read that this can have a negative effect, even if they are not displayed."
5037,1291899006,1304301167,Bitter frustration,"Good point. For each (unwanted) notice, your error_reporting() function will trigger and mess up the performance. It will depend on the number of (unwanted) notices.
Even when you can suppress the notices/warnings, the big problem are the other fatal errors (eg: `count($undefinedVar)`)
We never managed to finish upgrading all our old PHP projects and in some cases we will probably have to stick to PHP 5.6 until someone forks PHP to support backward compatibility.
And in the case of the projects we upgraded, once in a while, a new backwards-incompatible fatal error is discovered.

So a lot of projects grew quite quickly without worrying about the programming style - especially since it worked. I think some things are simply unnecessary.

5044,1291899006,1308054189,None,"I can think of at least 4 compromise options that would help...
1. Add a simple syntactic sugar for testing if a variable is truthy, without throwing an error. E.g.
`if (full($x))`
this would be exactly equivalent to `if (!empty($x))`
but without the logical inverse that makes for awkward readability.
2. Fix the precedence order to have `==` below `??`.
It's rather confusing that:
`if ($_GET['x']??null == false)` does not do what you expect. One would expect it to merely silence the warning, but it actually inverts the test, because the precedence is actually:
`if ($_GET['x'] (??null == false))` i.e.
`if ($_GET['x']??true)` 3. Treat a plain `if()` as allowing for undefined values. Thus `if($x)` emits no errors, while e.g. `$x++;` would.
4. Add a pragma or compiler directive, similar to Python 2's ""from future import division"". It would be something like
`ini_set(undefined_variables_are_null)` and would result in any undefined variable being treated as null, *without* emitting any error or warning, and would give instant backward-compatibility where needed, and solves the main motivation for the PHP9 pending change for the sake of the error-handling routines).
HTH."

Only if the the outside world it interacts with never changes.
One of the oldest software libraries in the world (it dates from the 1970s) was most recently updated last month; there is always room for improvement.

Is there any point in continuing commenting on this issue? What's the goal of participating in this echo chamber? Is there an expectation that some some critical number of +1/-1 reactions will reverse a decision made and deployed more than 2 years ago in a new major version of the language?
Is there a belief that complaining about how legacy code from 10 years ago now runs with one more warning on modern PHP will accomplish some purpose? Is it PHP's responsibility to make sure that nobody has to change their code, even when they were observing risky and bug-prone practices? How long must it maintain compatibility with programming paradigms that date back to the '90s?
There are solutions available to you right now to deal with this new _warning_. Yes, you have to edit your code, and if you want to run old code on new software while knowing you can't afford to keep it up to date then I'm sorry you've decided to put yourself into that position. But in the meantime, PHP can't wait around for you."
5051,1291899006,1345461795,Entitlement,"Yes. There is high expectation this bad decision will be reverted or that a solution will be provided so we can coexist as a PHP community with one single codebase.
There is also high expectation you will manage to understand that we are not talking about ""risky"" or ""bug prone"" coding practices here, but we are defending a legitim vision which is the simple essence of the PHP language and that having to define every variable, array index, etc. is absurd and results in ugly code.
If you don't agree, fine, go and enable your strict validations for yourself, but please don't screw the rest of us. And if it's not possible to coexist, than fork away. We are professionals and we care our business.
Again, your assumption that our code is old fashioned legacy code or that we are following bad practices is wrong, arrogant and unrespectful.
To make it even clearer: You are causing us damage so we are pissed off and hate you. We are not thanking you for your strict validations or for forcing us to rewrite our clean and stable code.
And this here is the best place where we can express our hate and get together to protest against your bad decision until you fix it. Meanwhile new people will come here looking for a solution and the voting will never end.
Your reasons are wrong and we believe you are arrogant when you try to impose your ridiculous paranoid coding style where everything must be previously defined or checked. Maybe it's ok for some variables in a simple ""personal home page"" script, but when you developed a framework that handles arrays and keys that are not predefined, it's a nightmare. And then when you see how ugly the adapted code ends looking like, it's clear this can't be for real.
You probably thought you are smarter or a better coder than we are, and that everybody should follow your new coding style, but no, you are only arrogant and blind, and you should also have expected the obvious consequences of this silly invasive decision you are trying to defend.
You are also wrong when you say that there is a workaround we could use, because in some cases PHP8 throws fatal errors instead of warnings while the triggering criteria behind is basically the same (inconsistent behavior). And according to the roadmap, you will continue going in the wrong direction."
5052,1291899006,1345516154,Bitter frustration,"There is nothing I could say better.
@kripper said everything perfectly. Thank you.
There are thousands of php programmers that still use php7 because of those stupid changes. Our code is clean and perfect. This is not just a few changes it's thousands of changes in a clean and good code.
Php development team must find a solution and not just be arrogant."
5053,1291899006,1346103106,Bitter frustration,"Another aspect: With the decision, many projects that are running well become uneconomical, as a rebuild consumes many many resources. I can live quite well from my project, but if I had paid for the rebuild, I would have to file for bankruptcy now.

1. In the case of reading from an un-initialised variable, this might indicate an error (e.g. a typo in the name), or it might indicate that the programmer has taken a shortcut by relying on the old behaviour. The warning is useful about 50% of the time. Furthermore, fixing it is trivial (just initialise variables before use), and it doesn't reduce code-readability. So, warning about this is probably sensible. 2. In the case of reading from an un-initialised array-key, this could possibly indicate an error, but it is far more likely to indicate that the array simply doesn't have all the keys all the time - that is, after all, the point of an associative array - it's supposed to have a variable number of keys. The behaviour is likely to be intentional, and the warning is rarely useful. Fixing this is difficult (you have to initialise every key of the array, even if you don't expect to use it), and it's particularly painful if your array comes from an outside source (e.g. JSON, or $_GET). Doing it with 2D associative arrays would be really ugly. Working around this to suppress the warning results in far less readable code. In addition, the first test in:
```
if ( isset($arr['key']) && ($arr['key'] == 'somevalue') )
```
is logically redundant.
So, I agree with case #1, but I don't think the rationale for #1 justifies applying the same policy to #2. Please can I encourage a change-of-heart here. Thanks."

>The function should return True only if Pac-Man has a power pellet active and is touching a ghost.
What is being set is the function's return value. It's not simply a matter of returning the parameters. It's a matter of how they are joined in the returned expression.
` return power_pellet_active or touching_ghost`
is returning the parameters, but not in a way to solve the task. I think the instructions make clear the arguments to the two parameters are used to set the return value from the function. The instructions begin with
>Define the eat_ghost() function that takes two parameters (if Pac-Man has a power pellet active and if Pac-Man is touching a ghost) and returns a Boolean value if Pac-Man is able to eat the ghost.
In the 20+ times I've mentored this exercise I don't recollect any student saying they've been confused by the instructions for that task. They sometimes do more than they need to solve it by setting the expression to a variable and then returning the variable, or by using if/else when they can just return the parameters joined with the correct logical operator, but they get the general gist.
Clearness of the instructions is taken just as seriously as not modifying the instructions unnecessarily. It's a pain for everyone when their completed solution becomes outdated just from a change to the instructions. If there were multiple people complaining about these instructions being unclear, then a re-evaluation of them would certainly be in order. But, sorry, that is less likely to happen with a one-off complaint, no matter how fervent it may be."

Not sure if this is a Werkzeug or flask-login problem but it's not the first time when those two stopped working together at some point of time (It happened I think for the 3rd time over last few years). So maybe that would be good idea that maintainer of the two project talk to each other and agree on some ""non-breaking"" rules that the two projects will follow - if both of those projects are so ""fundamental"" for a number of other projects??
It could either be as simple as putting an upper-bound in flask-login, to limit to ""known-working werkzeug version"" following some agreement on when breaking changes are introduced in werkzeug (maybe starting following SemVer is a good idea) and generally agreeing what is teh ""API"" of werkzeug that is supposed to be non-braking.

I don't use flask-login, but this kind of upper bound is incredibly annoying:
- if there's a werkzeug update the end user wants to install, they need to wait for a flask-login update
- even if there is such a flask-login update, it may also contain other changes, new features, etc. so suddenly wanting to update werkzeug requires looking into whatever else changed in flask-login.
all something you can avoid easily by pinning your transitive dependencies..."
5094,1300661048,1193948537,None,"> all something you can avoid easily by pinning your transitive dependencies...
We do already. But pinning dependencies is only half-solving the problem. The problem is that regardless if you are using pinning or not when you release your software, you usually do not pin your dependencies in development (unless you want your dependencies to go stale). So such a breaking release imacts PR/development workflow more than release workflow.
The main problem is that things break in random moments of when Flask-Login + Werkzeug are released - without even either of them bumping the major version (which is usually an indication of breaking chnages if you follow Semver). So if you are building your development workflow (where you do not want to pin the dependencies), there is no ""reasonable"" approach you can make to a) get latest versions with bugixes and b) get it non-breaking PRs of your users. It does not have to be ""upper-binding"". It might be simple agreement on what constitute of an API of werkzeug so that MINOR versions do not break the APIs.
So my gentle proposal is about that. I am not pushing - this was merely a suggestion that it would be much better for the community of your users if you agree some ways how we can ""sanely"" rely on the combo of flask-login and werkzeug not braking compatibility. It does not have to upper-binding, but some way of indicating to your users how they can constraint their dependencies in their development workflow to keep your development environment ""working"" - and not prone to external depenencies breaking your workflow.
We are using sophisticated mechanism to control our dependencies. In our case all our released versions of Airflow have automatically generated constraint files. And this is the only reason why such an incompatibility is not causing us bigger troubles. There are good reasons we cannot pin transitive dependencies in Airlfow ""setup.py"" and ""setup.cfg"" (because airlfow is both a library and application) but we implemented constraint mechanism which very much shield us from such breakages induced by external dependency changes. When we did not have them, such Werkzeug breakeges caused much more trouble for us, that's why we implemented constraints. This is a note from our nnouncements back from Feb 2020, were we had to bend the ASF rules on releases and release 1.10.9 same day as 1.10.8 becaue Werkzeug release broke it: https://airflow.apache.org/announcements/#feb-7-2020
> Feb 7, 2020
> We’ve just released Airflow v1.10.8
> and
> We’ve just released Airflow 1.10.9 (this one is a quick fix to work around the breaking release of Werkzeug 1.0)
So I do realise importance of pinnning, but I am talking about something different here.
BTW. If you are insterested why pinning ""install required"" dependencies is not always best you can read more here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#dependency-management
or you can read the talk I gave about it few months ago:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjMdQLP30s&t=2549s - ""Managing dependencies at Scale""."

IMHO you should use the same deps for dev as you use for production, and be more explicit about updating dependencies at some point (e.g. a `pip-compile -U`) where you then check if anything broke, look through changelogs, etc. and commit the new pins. With unpinned dev dependencies you never know if/when something is going to break, and it's generally a mess when working in a team where one team member has some problem, while another cannot reproduce it since they have other dependency versions..."

Please watch my talk why it is impossible for us to do manually (and I do recommend that your advises are based on research first). We have ~ 600 depenencies in airflow with consittue ~20 updates per week and it woudl be impossible to keep them manually updated. But we do have it implemented as you say - only automatically. And we DO keep a consistent set of dependencies for development (we keep all the 600 dependencies updated automatically for ""most"" developers and ""most PRs"" of our contributors (we have > 2100 contributors and sometimes 30 PRs merged a day). We even have a super sophisticated solution that automatically builds Dev Docker container with all the deps - and ONLY upgrade the dependencies when all the tests are passing. So you are advising something that we have done long time ago automated and run for years already. And again - I am not talking about this. Those ""dev deps constraints"" do not work for some of PRs that are updating other dependencies - this is where we have problems. This problem affected maybe 10% of our PRs. So this is not a huge problem for us.
What I am merely suggesting - is that the two projects talk to each other and agree some rules that will enable us to avoid breaking even the 10% of the PRs. This has happened not only once, so as a good community citizen, I suggest that both projects can do better when cooperating on that - no more, no less."

Create a new set of hierarchical groups that are mapped **losslessly** from captures (e.g., `@keyword.special`), with sane fallback to defaults.
1. Implicitly generate a highlight group for every capture, e.g., `TS.keyword.special` that can be mapped directly (but isn’t necessary by default)
2. Groups are implicitly language-specific, e.g., `TS.keyword.special.lua`
3. If not mapped, they successively fall back to the top level, e.g., `TS.keyword` (**Question:** fallback to `TS.keyword.special` or `TS.keyword.lua` first?)
4. Provide a set of top-level (and possibly _some_ second-level?) groups that are linked by default to suitable standard Vim groups and/or are mapped by the default and bundled color schemes. These groups need not derive from the set of standard Vim groups; it might be better to provide a small(!) number of different sets for different types of languages (with overlap), like ""imperative languages"" (C, Lua, Python, ...), ""markup languages"" (Markdown, LaTeX, HTML), ""data representation languages"" (JSON, regex, ...).
5. Languages are free to extend the capture hierarchy, e.g., `@snowflake.superfancy`, with the clear understanding that these won’t be highlighted unless mapped by custom colorschemes or plugins. (This also allows optional highlighting that is disabled by default.)
Ideally, we can use capture names directly as highlight groups, similarly to how syntax and highlight groups are matched?"

Hi @Portisch - without going into a he says/she says… I can categorically state that the code I submitted is my own. It has been on my work list for a long time; in my branch, mailing lists, logs, and in the forum, in this issue and the PR. Every bump of samba has had me looking at it again. In terms of your quoted comment - actually it is not the reason for the issue - the samba compile is not done as an “Active Directory Domain Controller”. Though you are right - that the answer was staring us all in the face… “samba-dcerpcd”
I can share the details on my working (straces/logs/…) - the lights on moment with discovery of the solution was firstly the /tmp/srvsvc in the log which did send me to read the change log again. But just adding samba-dcerpcd into the compile list = no success…. sbin - no success, then local_np.c: dyn_SAMBA_LIBEXECDIR via strings on the /usr/lib/…
So whilst timing is a coincidence - I reiterate - my work is original.
I go out of my way to ensure that attribution is correct, and update the authorship from myself to the author when it is not from me or co-authored. I have worked with @vpeter4 on PRs previously and hope to continue doing so. I do not and would not blatantly rip other peoples code off.

Steps to reproduce the problem:
1. We use a simple iframe to display PDF, nothing fancy (src = ""/ViewerJS/?zoom=page-width#../Uploads/EDocPro/EDT-21072022-163634.pdf""
2.PDF opens and displays what I guess is a template used by the supplier without the Invoice particulars
3. If I open with Acrobat or Acrobat Reader or the https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html it displays correctly with the full text
As the PDF is not ours but something supplied to us we have no control over the fonts etc (I presume its something like that), how can we force the viewer to display it ?

5166,1317881905,1317881905,None,"VERY predictable output from random(), after being seeded with an incrementing counter.
Attached sketch shows how I'm getting four streams of almost perfectly sequential numbers from an algorithm that uses multiple calls to random() after using an incrementing counter as a seed via randomSeed(). It should not be possible to get anything orderly from that, especially over such an immediately short period.
The sketch (below) produces mac-addresses as my original script does, then has four columns: The first three columns show sequential numbers from the high-byte of the last octet, the fourth column shows sequential numbers from the low-byte of the last octet.

That's seeded with 0x3ffe883c, and that output is near the beginning.
The first three columns to the right of the MAC addresses all show the high-byte of the last octet:
* The 1st column shows 0xf - 0xf, sequentially
* The 2nd column shows 0x4 - 0x4, sequentially
* The 3rd column shows 0x9 - 0x9, sequentially
The 4th column counts the low-byte of the last octet over a longer period, but the whole pattern repeats almost perfectly, and seemingly indefinitely, regardless of how it's seeded. Not the behaviour I expect from a PRNG!
Just looking at the ""random"" MAC addresses I was wanting, it's obvious that the low-byte of the last octet is repeating for 14-15 times (14.7, on average) and then incrementing. Again, should be 100% impossible to get this from any self-respecting PRNG being seeded by a counter.
nb the sketch has a delay() towards the bottom, so it scrolls up on a console at human-readable speed. For data-collection, just comment out the delay.
nb2 the random seed can be set manually.

===========================================
buggy ""random()"" function, as observed here:
https://github.com/atom-smasher/esp8266_beaconSpam
this sketch starts with a random seed ""randomMacSeed""
that seeds the prng via ""randomSeed()"" and an incrementing counter
calls to ""random()"" are producing some very predictable outputs!
this sketch shows the mac-addresses as they would be generated,
and derived from those mac-addresses are four columns, all counting
incrementally, with very few errors
expected results: using an incrementing counter to seed the prng, i expect
to NOT have predictable output like this

### Overview
The issue seems to be in our Android build of Expo Go. Snack and the Expo Go version for SDK 46 (`2.51.x`) are affected and will not show Google Maps during development.
> ~~I'll update the comment whenever we deployed the fixed Expo Go version to the stores.~~
- Expo Go `2.25.2` is [available on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
- Expo Go `2.52.2` has been deployed to Snack
### Workarounds
1. Use a [custom dev client](https://docs.expo.dev/development/getting-started/) with your own Google Maps key. It's similar to the bare workflow approach some of you mentioned. This method also allows you to install the latest version `react-native-maps@1.2.0` in your app. You can use [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) to build the app if you don't have the Android SDK installed.
_**I would heavily recommend this method for now**_
2. Temporarily downgrade to SDK 45 to use an older Expo Go. This method would allow you to use the previous Expo Go version. You'll need to remove Expo Go from your Android phone or simulator to do this. Whenever you start your SDK 45 project with `expo start --android`, and your device is connected through USB and ADB, it will automatically install this Expo Go version.

Yes, that assumption is right! We found an issue that only relates to the Expo Go builds and not your production apps. Even apps built with the classic build system (`expo build`) are not affected. But, because we use Expo Go in Snack too, Snack is also affected.
---
> @brentvatne development builds don't allow hot reload, right? We use expo go during dev in Wi-Fi because unlike an emulator it gives all features of a real device.
Expo dev client builds are fully capable of doing hot reload. I would suggest to try it out :)

The Expo dev client and EAS allow you to pick any native module as you see fit. I'm sorry you had an unfortunate experience with `react-native-firebase`, I'm not sure if [you followed these steps](https://rnfirebase.io/#expo) but some libraries require you to add credentials, even in development mode. We can't control that outside of Expo Go and/or for third party libraries.

> @da45 please calm down. It's good engineering practice to try to find workarounds. Often it unblocks at least some percentage of users.
I fully agree with this. We don't intend to break things, but if they do, we try to keep everyone as ""unblocked"" as possible while we fix things. We still have to go through store review whenever we fix it, [which took ±15 days on the Play Store for SDK 46](https://twitter.com/cedricvanputten/status/1557375168955252738). So I think there is a lot of value in sharing these workarounds.

If you added the `android.config.googleMaps.apiKey` after running `expo run:*` or `expo prebuild`, it needs to recreate the native files. These keys are set in your native files that `expo prebuild` generates.
You can try running `expo prebuild --clean` and see if `expo run:*` works."

First of all, connecting to the server is only something that happens during download. OSMAnd is an offline map and downloads happen rarely. For heavy users less than once a month, for many much less than that. Additionally, all such downloads are user-initiated, they have to explicitly press a download button. Nothing that would be useful to build a profile of any specific user.
**Allegations of travel data and such being leaked are thus really not in evidence.**
The data that is being shared is not possible to connect to any personally identifying information. Notice that google explains that since some 5 years the `getUserAndroidId` is unique per installed application. So any other application the user uses (on the same phone, or not) will not share the UUID. So on top of the fact that not much of a profile can be made at all, there is no way to connect such to any actual personal info.
Does anyone actually have any real issues with the existing code?

A user's travel history often uniquely identifies a person. The list of client ips and timestamps is the ""actual personal info"".
Dismissing the issue does not change the fact: you have no consent from the user for such tracking.
Common sense is not co-opting the user's device to transmit tracking identifiers without their advance knowledge and opt-in consent."
5238,1336452733,1214327968,None,"I think there are 2 direction of discussions: consent and identification.
1. I don't think consent is needed, same as you don't need consent that your IP is used to download maps. Second it's not a website where you read information, here you use resources, so in that sense by downloading data you agree to fair use of resources (Terms of Service) and in that case you agree that you don't download too many resources especially if you are not paid user for example
It would be completely different case if program would send statistics in background that you're using the application and here is an IP. To summarize: it's probably needs to be more clarified in Terms of Service but it doesn't require a consent.
2. User identification. We switched from IP to UUID to calculate how many active users & how often update exactly to solve the server load issue and don't use personal data. For example we don't require email to identify user and don't track IP exactly cause IP could provide location specific information. Random UUID **doesn't identify anything** if it's not connected to any other services or other private information. We don't share UUID with any other applications so they also couldn't track that UUID even if these apps have personal information.
It's completely incorrect to say that app could view **travel history**, I would say it's total nonsense cause the server only views what and when maps were downloaded in contrast of other apps that provide Internet services. -----------------
Last but not least.
The websites require to ask consent only for information they gather for example if you search an address on website and website doesn't store these addresses or don't connect them to IP (address is essentially publicly available information), consent is not needed. If the website will start storing information in the table [IP, Search], then consent is needed. So it's all about how the data is processed and used and not only what's being transmitted."
5239,1336452733,1214329171,None,"Just to provide another point of view on this topic. As a Service provider I need a unique identifier to predict the load on servers (especially once maps are updated), so in the end it would say:
""Download maps won't be provided if user doesn't agree to create a random key for the installation"".
Does it makes sense then to implement at all ? Cause in the end it will end up, if you to download - you need a consent which to me is actually totally clear if you don't want to know what & when you downloaded - download or generate maps yourself and import to the app. **App won't send to the server what you've imported yourself!**"

Maybe the problem lies that nobody explained in technical details what it means for OSMAnd to be an offline map.
It means that the application, when started, does not cause any network traffic at all. You can travel and use the map daily, including searches for point-of-interests and doing routing, without ever causing a single download. Without, specifically, leaking that uuid.
OSMAnd, in other words, is perfectly useful and allows people to use the app for months or years without ever triggering the download you have noticed sends an UUID. People can download all their data at home or at work, regardless of where they travel later.
Sneak: you are wrong. It is time to admit you came to wrong conclusions and time to publicly show you are able to learn when presented with new facts. Thank you."
5245,1336452733,1214384066,None,"Let me summarize a bit.
* To keep the server load tolerable the admins want to limit the per-user-map-downloads
* To achieve that, OsmAnd creates an UUID with Java.util.UUID.randomUUID() (https://tutorialspoint.com/java/util/java_util_uuid.htm)
* The server logs all requests containing the UUID and the user's IP and stores it indefinitely
* The UUID is used to block too frequent downloads
**Consent**
I am no lawyer, but I would look at it by means of GDPR. However, I would agree with the accepted answer [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/48288) that there is no consent required.
**Concerns that come to mind**
Although I believe the claims that the UUID/IPs are never shared with any third party, I think it would be better to not have to trust anyone. Maybe one day the server gets hacked or the admins are forced to hand over all data to law enforcement.
Indeed I don't like the idea that all my IP history gets into the wrong hands. IP adresses are not anonymous and can be assigned to individuals in many ways. Flourishing VPN services show that people understood that.
**Ideas for compromises**
Sadly, I have no idea that takes no development effort. Although I believe that the effort would be manageable. Here are two:
* UUID could be re-generated e.g. when more than 2 weeks have passed. For that, OsmAnd would need to store an additional timestamp together with the UUID
* Records could be deleted on a regular basis on the server-side
* @scaidermern had [another one](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-iOS/issues/2115#issuecomment-1212955350)"

This is true. But it limits the average user case, where the user does not manipulate the request just to download some maps and I guess, this comprises almost 100% of all users."
5248,1336452733,1214898007,None,"@saddy001 - agree that server has no control but practically it's unsolvable issue cause indeed anything could happen on the server side (i.e. hacked or rights transferred). In the end it would be a liable action or reputation loss. - We gather general statistics by 1 month mostly though I would tend agree to regenerate every 3 months cause then we could generate quarter reports
- We also need to spend time on server side to correctly clean the data and leave just summary reports without any private information. For that matter we need to do proper automation and standardize reports a bit .

You can do this of course. However, how many users do you expect to use your fork? I bet the above number will still remain close to 100%.

A unique identifier that, in contrast to the IP address, can't be easily anonymised by the user and that also persists across IP addresses “preserves the privacy”? Surely, Google uses those Android ad IDs because they're so incredibly anonymous.
>You don't need to use OsmAnd Services if you don't agree with Terms of Use
Besides the fact that privacy laws are a thing, this is incredibly detrimental to say, considering that OsmAnd has always presented itself as a privacy-friendly alternative to commercial services.

>you can download or build maps yourself
This is not an option for probably 99% of users.
I agree that this unique ID is not as bad as the issue's author claimed it to be. However, I also think that OsmAnd should not be designed in a way that could theoretically enable behavioural tracking.
Would simply re-generating the ID at regular intervals really be too difficult? In my opinion, it would be such an easy way to improve everyone's privacy and to calm anyone who's worried."

@sneak Yes, UUID is PII. But so is IP address itself [according to GDPR](https://www.gdpreu.org/the-regulation/key-concepts/personal-data/). So _even_ if there were **no** UUID **at all**, PII would **_still_** be transmitted and stored by OsmAnd servers. Thanks for pointing to this issue, but I think it is now time to stop beating a dead horse (we get it: current OsmAnd situation is not perfect, but they seem to recognize the problem and look willing to improve on it, so let's try to **not** paint them as villains worse than Google or Microsoft - for the time being, eh?) and concentrate on **how to best address this issue** - in an **_actionable way_** that is acceptable both to privacy-oriented users and OsmAnd server admins, while also following [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-consent-requirements/) and other applicable laws.
My suggestions:
- randomize said UUID often - e.g. as suggested by @scaidermern in https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-iOS/issues/2115#issuecomment-1212955350
- change privacy policy at https://osmand.net/help-online/privacy-policy/#3-the-information-company-collects to be both correct and up-to-date, and with an explanation **_why_** something is being done (e.g. something akin to `... when downloading maps from within OsmAnd, your IP address and randomly generated unique identifier are transmitted to OsmAnd servers in order to facilitate download and prevent server load issues & abusive behaviour, as well as generate map popularity statistics. That unique identifier is regenerated every XXXXX days/hours/xxxx. If you download maps manually outside of OsmAnd, the unique identifier will never be sent to OsmAnd servers nor elsewhere...`). While updating it, please also take notice of editing plugin and its set of additional privacy issues. Nice example of IMHO clear and useful privacy policy is at https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/blob/v45.2/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml#L314-L336 ; one may want to pick ideas/text from there.
- also, what does `Settings` / `Analytics` / `Maps downloaded` change when turned off? I mean, by the nature of transferring the map the OsmAnd servers would know what maps are downloaded from the app, regardless of this flag. Does this also share the information about maps downloaded outside of OsmAnd? Or does it collect, but then not count/process information about maps downloaded from users with this turned off? I.e. what is exactly the difference between `on` and `off` there?
- actually _link_ to said privacy policy from within OsmAnd app in `Help` menu. At least I can't seem to find it there."

1. Providing UUID is part of Terms of Usage of OsmAnd Online Services such as downloading maps. UUID or account id for OsmAnd PRO will always be part of request
2. OsmAnd Online Services are **not unique** way to use OsmAnd Client application. Maps could be downloaded or generated manually. So there is no issue that OsmAnd Client hiddenly transmits private data

This misunderstands what identification means.
The UUID uniquely identifies a user when combined with a series of differing client IPs. It doesn't need to resolve *in your systems* to a user's name or photo; the fact is that the UUID represents one and only one user. This allows you to track *that one user's* movements from city to city (as you see different client IP locations).
It's irrelevant that you don't know the user's name; you have your own name for them - a UUID.
You don't have consent to track users in this manner without an opt-in. This UUID is a unique tracking identifier, akin to a cookie (although it's sent in the query string and not the HTTP header, the effect is the same) and it's for a nonessential purpose (tracking user count statistics). It's unnecessary for this purpose, anyway."

If OsmAnd B.V. _or_ their users are situated in European Union (and they are), they will **need to follow the GDPR**.
- @sneak note that _user consent_ is only **_one of six_** allowable ways for [obtaining legal basis for data processing](https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-consent-requirements/ ) - the OsmAnd B.V. might decide to use some other legal basis for data processing. In any case, they should consult a GDPR specialist and spell out in their Privacy Policy **exactly** what Personally Identifiable Information (like UUID or username, or IP addresses) is being collected, and specify in advance **all** purposes for which such data will be used, as well as other things (will that data be shared with third parties, stored/processed outside of EU etc.). If they later want to use PII for another purpose, they must re-obtain additional consent (or other legal basis) - they're not allowed to reuse previously collected data for new purpose retroactively. There are many things that need to be done correctly, which is why they should consult a GDPR specialist (disclaimer: I am not one so it is not an ad for myself; but I had to go thru the same pains, so I _am_ informed above average in the matter). There is a [checklist](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/) they might want to go through to verify if they did everything they need to.
- While having UUID might be required for some uses (e.g. all registered users), I would suggest _seriously considering options_ that require it as little as possible, especially for ""anonymous"" users. Any data collected has a chance to leak / be misused, so not collecting it in the first place would be smarter than having to invest resources and money to deal with protecting it adequately, and dealing with a possible breaches (and GDPR fines) later. Also, OSM crowd in particular are often much more biased to be privacy concerned (or they'd likely be using Google Maps in the first place) so it would be good business idea to try not to alienate them unnecessarily."

This is clearly false: for instance no specific explicit consent is needed for the transmission of the IP address that comes along with every TCP/IP request, when it's necessary to perform the action requested by the user. Otherwise you'd end up in a catch 22 situation where you need previous consent to allow the user to download the privacy policy where they'll learn how to provide consent."

This appears to send the number of days since install, as well as a unique identifier (`getUserAndroidId`), to the index server when fetching indices, without respect for the telemetry preference setting.
This is a data leak that allows for a user's travel history to be tracked by the server, as these requests include client IP and a unique tracking identifier, and client IP is coarse (city-level) geolocation. This means the server can see the various cities the given userIosId travels to as the client IP changes over time.
This spyware feature also exists in the iOS version, and fails to respect the user's consent choice there as well. It seems unlikely that this is an accident.

As I understood the **Summary** above, the outcome **_does_** change. In particular, your download request (in times of heightened load) might be slowed down significantly (or maybe even delayed for some time or completely refused until retried later when load is lower). As s side note, there are other privacy-related options that can be enabled/disabled at that screen, that you might want to check, as well other related system-wide options (i.e. Google's _""Improve Location Accuracy""_ setting, enabled by default on Android phones, leaks hugely bigger amount of privacy and location data, and has much worse privacy record than OsmAnd. Not to mention that if you used Google Play app store to download any of the apps, you are also leaking more privacy data daily than this UUID setting would if you left it in ""on"" position forever).
Not to say this isn't important, but _before_ starting worrying about default setting of this UUID setting, one _at minimum_ should be running [de-googlified ROM](https://replicant.us/) on their phone and using **exclusively** some [privacy oriented app-store dedicated to providing non-proprietary free software only](https://f-droid.org/) instead of Google one (or Apple's, but there is no way to avoid using IOS on iPhone devices AFAIK, so you are out of luck there in any case). Some people do, and thus _they_ might want to suggest (to _their_ app store!) to change that default (for _that_ app store users), yes. For Google Play and (Apple store) crowd who (willingly or unknowingly, regardless) continues to surrender their privacy daily anyway, I do not see much point in changing the OsmAnd UUID _default_, as it only would result in their OsmAnd experience getting worse, with no noticeable privacy improvement at all."

<!-- Explain your issue in detail. Issues without proper explanation are liable to be closed by maintainers. -->
the current filter applies a permanent blur to your screen, which is unbelievably ugly.
It also seems to be permanent unless healed with specific chems, which makes it agonizing if there's no medical.
Welding already blinds you when it's active. This just seems like an unnecessary kick in the balls that makes the game look like ass.

While it is possible to filter out assets in a schema, it's not possible to filter out schemas in a database.
A solution could be to add another configuration node just for this, and let the user configure it. That way we don't need to make any assumptions about what the user thinks about `public`.

We can stop the discussion if you want, that's not an issue to me.
Anyway, as you can see, I have a proposal, you have a proposal, and there might be more solutions, but I might be wrong about my solution, because I don't know schema comparison that well. For instance, it's unclear where `listSchemaNames` kicks in.
Likewise, you might be wrong.
Also, the problem you're willing to solve is not worded clearly, I believe this is why this issue was closed. Shouldn't there be somewhere a sentence like: when I run a comparison between this schema and that schema, the diff should be empty, but isn't?
I think instead of jumping to solutions, you should do what @morozov asked and file a new issue with a clearly stated problem, expressed with the DBAL APIs (meaning high-level APIs). A test case would be best.
BTW, I'm talking about schema comparison, but it's unclear if the issue you are trying to fix is with schema comparison, with `Schema->toSql()` (used in `SchemaTool::getCreateSchemaSql()`, with `Schema->toDropSql()`, or a combination of those."

It's quite clear, yet it's not easy to reproduce with just the DBAL APIs. I would expect something like
```
$schema1 = …
$schema2->getMigrateFromSql($schema1)
```
From reading the issue, you can't tell if there is a bug in the DBAL, or if `doctrine/migrations` is misusing it.

Not sure how I missed that, that's indeed the case. The docs say this:
> Schema names beginning with pg_ are reserved for system purposes and cannot be created by users.
For public, you'll have to admit that it's different: it's kind of common for people to create table and indexes inside `public`, while they would never do that inside `information_schema` or schemas starting with `pg_`, right?
> I'm saying the minority are people that have both a DBA who deleted the public schema but at the same time would allow people to recreate it
There could also be other packages (different from ORM or migrations) relying on that method to display schema names, for purposes we don't know. The DBAL has 4k dependends: https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/dbal/dependents?order_by=downloads

For now 10 years `public` has been returned by `getSchemaNames` generating a lot of bug and weird behaviour in higher level libraries relying on it.
| Q | A
|------------ | ------
| Version | 3.x
#### Summary
For now 10 years since commit https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/commit/b89490a557584b61d575aaa67f8b386d833d5a0f (before that it was not working at all )
`public` is returned by PostgreSQLSchemaManager::getSchemaNames()
#### Current behaviour
<!-- What is the current (buggy) behaviour? -->
#### How to reproduce
(a reproducer is soon coming)
1. connect to any postgresql (a vanilla postgres docker is fine)
2. call PostgreSQLSchemaManager::getSchemaNames
-> public is returned among other user-defined schema
#### Expected behaviour
all application schema are returned , but not `public` (as well as other postgres-defined schema are also not returned
#### More context This bug is at least the root cause of these issues * https://github.com/doctrine/migrations/issues/441
* https://github.com/doctrine/migrations/issues/1196#issuecomment-1029706768
* https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1110

* https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/44952
the more visible issue of it is with doctrine migration: 1. all migrations contains a `down` migration trying to `CREATE SCHEMA public` that EVERYBODY deletes or workaround ( :100: if you
have done that too ) because it fails miserably (as it already exists)
2. to avoid dropping it , we don't drop schemas *at all* cf https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/pull/5604/files , so if automated generated migrations are not bijectives because `DROP SCHEMA` will never be generated. #### Why `public` should be considered a ""system schema"" 1. public is not created by the user
2. everybody assume that it is present
3. even postgres assumes it is present 4. it has a behaviour that no user-defined schema has (i.e omitting the name of the schema default to 'public' , i.e when you do `CREATE TABLE foobar` you're actually doing `CREATE TABLE public.foobar` 5. if a ill-advised user drop it, a lot of libraries get broken ( doctrine migration by default create is own internal table in the public namespace , so as this SQL runs *BEFORE* the first migration, you can't even create back `public` in the first migration as it will fail before)
6. weak argument: after 10 years of managing postgresql I never ever seen people dropping and even less (re)creating the public schema, the only case I could hypothetically see for it is a extremly ordered DBA that have severa applications on the same instance , and want each of them in its own schema to ease maintenance (but in that case it's the ""infrastrcture"" responsability to drop it once and for all, not one of the applications )
@morozov I understand the issue is ""scary"" because this library is a high profile one and after a time even bugs become part of the API , so I understand we may want to be careful on that one, so maybe we can find a deprecation strategy and changing this behaviour only on a minor/major release (at least not just a bug fix one)"

5364,1369100843,1253828416,None,I asked for something similar in #9243 as well.
5365,1369100843,1254323872,None,these look similar. Since multiple people are asking for similar functionality maybe it will get some traction.
5366,1369100843,1254413854,None,Can you add an example of custom field that would warrant such functionality ?
5367,1369100843,1254446691,None,"![device](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77940332/191647405-5b255fe0-cab4-4aa0-94a0-0ec7f8565789.PNG)

So let me describe my use case in more detail.
When you create a device template you can add 'power ports' to the template. When you add these power ports you are able to specify the maximum draw and allocated draw. Let's use easy numbers and say max draw is 100 watts, and allocated draw is 25 watts.
Now, when you create a new device from the device template that you just created the power ports are automatically added. And the max draw and allocated draw are already populated for you. Which is great! Now of course you can change these numbers per device if you so choose, but typically its unnecessary.
Now say we want to have a custom field on the power port. Currently, the custom field will only show up on the power port page when viewing a device. Not the device template. So if I wanted a custom field called 'BTU' that tracks the heat output of our power supplies I have to first create the device, then go to the power ports and fill in the BTU load for each device manually.
If the custom field 'BTU' were available on the device template, I could make the calculation and input the value just like I do for max draw and allocated draw. This way, when I create a new device from that device template, the BTU value is already filled out for me. Sure, I can change it if I need to (just like max draw), but the point is, the value is already filled in since its coming over from the device template."

5369,1369100843,1266397762,None,"Your previous comment was directly mentioning circumventing auto closure of the issue, which is explicitly against the rules.
In my opinion you still haven't explained how it should work in practice. Is it just matched by name the name of the field? What happens if customer field types do not match? In your FR you mention that it should be added to device and module types, but when you explain further you are referring component templates, is it both?
The proposal is still not very thorough in my opinion."
5370,1369100843,1267145866,Insulting,"What are you talking about?
custom fields are not going to be different field types between a device and a device template. It's the same field. You just are able to select the device template page inside the model(s) selection

Currently, if you apply a custom field to the ""DCIM > power port"" model it will only show up on the device power port page after a device is created. You should also be able to apply this same custom field to the 'power port' of a device template."

This is no way to talk. Locking this until we can figure out a way forward with regards to your agressive and hostile comments.
> custom fields are not going to be different field types between a device and a device template
There's no such thing as a device template. There's device types and devices, both can have independant custom fields. Then there are device components and device component templates, where only the first ones can have custom fields."
5372,1369100843,1293852746,None,Closing this as #9243 provides a much better description of the proposed feature.

v3.3.2
### Feature type
New functionality
### Proposed functionality
When creating custom fields, they only appear when working inside a device or module, not the device type or module type.
Please add the ability to have custom fields be part of the device type and module type areas of netbox.
Based on : https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/discussions/10293
### Use case
Our use case would be to add a custom field to a power port. Then when that power port is added to any device the custom field is already populated.
Similar to how maximum draw and allocated draw would already be present when adding a power port to a type.
Currently, you would have to create the device, go to the power port for the device AFTER its created, click edit, and populate the custom field every time for every device.
### Database changes
I'm unsure what kind of database requirements would be needed to add the ability for custom fields to show up on device type and module type pages.
### External dependencies
None that I can see."

All the data viz projects were created on our .rocks domain. We just need to replace the codepen URL's with the new addresses in the curriculum files of those five projects.
Here's the URL's:
https://25--5-clock.freecodecamp.rocks

https://javascript-calculator.freecodecamp.rocks
https://markdown-previewe.freecodecamp.rocks

Not really true. The official version of Visual Studio Code contains the trademark and some modifications by Microsoft, and is therefore subjected to [Microsoft's terms](https://code.visualstudio.com/License/). The pirate version definetely goes against the terms and must be taken down.
However though, if they do recompile VSCode removing nonfree bits, and give it a different trademark (like what the libre VSCodium is doing), yes, they do have the right to sell it. But what do you expect from a commercial pirate website?"

API is inconsistent and could be done better: ok, we can agree on that. But deprecate an extension system in full without a single day of discussion is unpleasant, especially if done in a such popular project like this one.
On technical aspects:
- some events can be replaced by middlewares: upgrade path here is clear and sound, but they are only two. Most of those cannot be replaced this way.
- generated/custom sql is not the only information carried by the event object: tables and columns for example can be retrieved and modified in the event handler.
- you suggested to extend the platform, but it is obviously too overkill when the only thing you have to do is to add a column to a table. On the contrary, when you need to modify various tables it is simpler and more maintenable to have such code in different classes you could unit-test separately.
- you also suggested to modify the input before using schema manager/platform, but this is not always feasible, especially when using the ORM.
- DDD is not the goal of this library, immutability is not required for the events. Events here are an extension point, not something to be saved/retained as part of the normal flow.
- dynamic method call is unreliable and api of the event manager can be fragile. Ok, but meanwhile some community standards have been published and widely used. Using a PSR-compatible event dispatcher can help to clean up the code and can help you to move the maintenance burden of the event manager to others.
IMHO the way this thing has been done is not very nice to the community, and lacked a wider vision on how this project is used in the wild. What makes me sad is the low consideration of the community feedback: 24 hours issue is barely a communication and left no space for discussion. To me this is not acceptable in a such important project: it is widely used, production apps are written onto it and should take this responsibility seriously giving the community the time to evaluate such an important change and express an opinion."

Do you think, an event handler is the best way to expose this kind of extension point? If you designed this feature from scratch, how would you build the extension point that you need for your scenario?
> you suggested to extend the platform, but it is obviously too overkill when the only thing you have to do is to add a column to a table.
Why would you need to hook into the DBAL to add a column? Why can't you add it to the schema directly? Sorry if my question sounds stupid, but I'd like to understand you problem before we decide on an action here.

The event manager is a trivial library. Sunsetting it is not our intention and certainly was not the motivation here."

From my POV, a discussion is needed before to take action, not after. This is a communication of what's have been already done, and doesn't matter if it can be un-done. A discussion can take place on a proposal, which this is not. This is a fact: events have been deprecated in the current public release and removed in the first beta of the next major version.
> Do you think, an event handler is the best way to expose this kind of extension point? If you designed this feature from scratch, how would you build the extension point that you need for your scenario?
Yes, why not? An entire framework (Symfony) has been written around an event manager, where handlers continuously modify and process information and structures, for example enhancing the request object, transforming the request body, etc.
Why DBAL cannot use the same flow?
To be clear: I don't mean that everything in the current event system is ok and does not need to be revisited/reworked, but surely I would retain the event system as a powerful extension point. > Why would you need to hook into the DBAL to add a column? Why can't you add it to the schema directly? Sorry if my question sounds stupid, but I'd like to understand you problem before we decide on an action here.
> Can you give us examples? Is this something the ORM should address instead?
I'll answer two questions here because they are connected. I'll give you some examples:
- I have an ORM entity with a ""priority"" field but I want to avoid that two records have the same exact value, so when you set a value that already exists, all the values after it needs to be updated. The ORM can handle it, but its very costly, so I made an optimization with a trigger that involves an additional column on that table. At the same time I want that column to be hidden from the ORM, it does not really exist, it's an implementation detail. Using the migrations library I cannot modify the schema in the middle of the process, I have to hook into DBAL and add the column when necessary.
- I wrote a Symfony Messenger transport that uses DBAL as storage backend. I want its tables and resources to be completely hidden from the ORM. In the bundle I have to register an event handler to generate the resources on schema creation so the doctrine's commands will work with no additional configuration.
- I have an application that uses a table with the ""ARCHIVE"" mysql engine. Using the ORM I cannot set it correctly, I have to hook into the schema generation process and modify the engine from ""InnoDB"" to ""ARCHIVE"".
- In an application I want to generate a VIEW resource alongside a normal table: this is something that cannot be done into the ORM. To work with schema commands and migrations I have to hook into DBAL in the middle of the schema generation.
- For a translation system I have to dynamically generate translation tables to be used as storage for the various ""translatable"" resources: again this is something that needs to be hidden from the ORM, but needs to work with schema commands and migrations.
> The event manager is a trivial library. Sunsetting it is not our intention and certainly was not the motivation here.
So those listed under ""Problems with the EventManager API as such"" are not valid reasons to deprecate and remove the event system? Because a PSR-compatible event dispatcher will solve both problems. And lately, will increase the integration level with the frameworks in general."

And you would've participated in that discussion? Would you have noticed that it even happens? During the last months of DBAL development, I have barely seen any real discussion going on any PR. Users of the DBAL don't monitor this repository and that's absolutely okay. Trust me: We could've kept that PR open for two more weeks and the only difference would've been that you would have one thing less to complain about.
Really, I value every constructive feedback that we get from the community. But please think about how you address people who invest their free-time to build libraries that you can use for free. A phrase like ""this is not acceptable"" feels a bit inappropriate here, don't you think?
> Using the migrations library I cannot modify the schema in the middle of the process, I have to hook into DBAL and add the column when necessary.
I think, this is the issue we have to solve. We need to enable you to modify the schema _after_ the ORM has generted it from the metadata and _before_ it's being used for comparisons with the actual database.
> I have an application that uses a table with the ""ARCHIVE"" mysql engine. Using the ORM I cannot set it correctly, I have to hook into the schema generation process and modify the engine from ""InnoDB"" to ""ARCHIVE"".
Do you think, we should enable you configure vendor-specific tweaks like that in the ORM?

You should be abler to configure patterns of table names that should be ignored during schema comparisons, shouldn't you? I have to look that up though, not entirely sure about how to configure that.

No, if those were our only problems with the event system, we wouldn't have deprecated it. You are right, a PSR-4 dispatcher would be the solution here.

That's the problem the event system resolved. If we can find an alternative way, then the migration path would be clear and sound and will not be a feature removal.
> Do you think, we should enable you configure vendor-specific tweaks like that in the ORM?
IMHO no, it's not a thing the ORM should handle. It is a detail that has no space in the ORM, but the underlying library (this one) should do.
> You should be abler to configure patterns of table names that should be ignored during schema comparisons, shouldn't you? I have to look that up though, not entirely sure about how to configure that.
I try to explain it better: I don't want to simply ignore some assets, I need to generate them alongside the tables and columns of the schema generated by the ORM. Solving the problem of modifying the schema generated by the ORM before passing it to DBAL will probably work for these two.
In any case, you should allow to modify and inject custom SQL in the process, or we have the same problem.
> No, if those were our only problems with the event system, we wouldn't have deprecated it. You are right, a PSR-4 dispatcher would be the solution here.
I did not write that they are the *only* problems, but that we shouldn't consider them as valid reasons for this change, so we can remove them from the discussion.

The way you lecture us on how our development process should look like is really disrespectful. ""This is my opinion"" is really a weak argument for any conversation. If you just want to state your opinion, keep it for yourself next time.

No, the event system healed a missing extension point. You hooked into the DBAL because you could not hook into the ORMs schema generation.

I cannot hook into the ORM schema generation, but even if I could, it will not resolve the point of setting vendor-specific details on how the table/view/... should be created.
To be more clear, I'll give you an example: the `buildCreateTableSQL` method does not contain a way to completely override the generated SQL and the `Table` class does not contain something like the `columnDefinition` property. This means that if I want to override the way the asset is created, now I cannot do it, and the ORM hook after the schema generation will not help in doing so.
Also, appending custom SQL to the generated asset (schema/table/view/index/etc) is not possible with the current objects.
Hooking in the ORM processes will not solve these problems, not with the objects and tools we have at the moment.
I did not meant to hurt or offend anyone, but you're going down on a personal level in the last message.
> ""This is my opinion"" is really a weak argument for any conversation.
Sorry, but on if, when and how to deprecate something, every decision is opinion based. So ""this is my opinion"" is the only thing that counts, because there are no technical reasons to remove something that works and worked well for years.
Also you have never written ""IMHO"" under an issue/PR on github? You're really saying that everyone expressing his own opinion is wasting his time?

The Doctrine project values constructive feedback from users of our libraries. If a change that we've shipped caused trouble in one of your projects, get in touch with us. We are very careful not to break downstream code, but if we do, it certainly does not happen on purpose.
⚠️ That being said, if I have to read that one of my fellow maintainers, who has invested a lot of work hours in maintaining and modernizing this library, ""lacks vision"" and that the way he managed one particular change is ""not acceptable"" – Crap like that that really gets me on the fence. In the last years, I have seen fine people retiring from open-source because of stress and mental health issues. Let me be crystal clear: I won't tolerate this kind of bullying here.
Back to topic: I understand that if you rely heavily on DBAL's events, the deprecation of the event system might appear a bit premature. But as of today, DBAL 3 is still maintained and the event system is still working. We've release DBAL 4 as a first beta and don't have a release date for a final version yet.
Right now, you can help us smoothen the upgrade path and shape the 4.0 release with us. The Doctrine project is maintained by very few people in their free-time. Any additional help is appreciated.
I have created issues for the 3.6.0 milestone from the feedback I've gathered after the 3.5 release. Comment on those or open new issues if you think, we've missed something. This issue will be locked now."
5673,1418577350,1418577350,None,"Recently, I tried to enable checking exceptions in PHPStan and, besides a few other issues with the DBAL API, stumbled upon the one that shows what an awfully overcomplicated piece of work the Events API is:
1. `AbstractPlatform::getDropTableSQL()` dispatches an `onSchemaDropTable` event which can override the SQL used to drop the table.
2. The return type of `SchemaDropTableEventArgs::getSql()` is `?string`. If it returns `NULL`, the platform will throw an `UnexpectedValueException`.
3. There's no way to tell that a given method is an event handler unless it's documented as such or whoever reads the code knows that the methods with names starting with `on` are event handlers. Those methods are not invoked from anywhere in the code explicitly.
Here's a chain of questions that leads to the above conclusion:
1. Why is `SchemaDropTableEventArgs` allowed to return `NULL` if it's not even a valid value?
2. We could require that it returns a `string` but then what would it return if the handler of the event didn't call `setSql()`?
4. Putting aside the event-handling scenario, what should the `SchemaDropTableEventArgs` class do if it was instantiated and then got its `setSql()` invoked? Maybe throw a logical exception?
5. Then, should it throw this exception unconditionally or only if it got a call to `preventDefault()` first?
### Problems with the API design and implementation
What this API does, most likely could be solved just by extending the platform class and overriding the corresponding methods. Besides this awfully implicitly stateful logic, a few more concerns about DDL events:
1. It looks like it's an overengineered solution to what could be easily solved by extending the corresponding platform methods.
2. Unlike extending the platform, events don't allow invoking the default implementation (the method of the `parent` class).
3. Unlike class extension, events don't provide access to the original logic like a call to the `parent` method would.
4. The DDL events API is incomplete (e.g. one can override `DROP TABLE` but cannot override `DROP FOREIGN KEY`).
6. In event-driven systems and DDD, an event is an immutable object representing a fact that happened in the past. Which fact does an `onSchemaDropTable` event represent? Let's assume it's a fact that somebody intended to drop a table. Why is it mutable? Why does it carry any information about processing the event (prevent default) and even implementation of that processing (SQL)?
7. For 800 lines of production code, there are three unit tests with mocks and not a single integration test which would demonstrate how this API can be used and if it can be used at all.
8. The documentation shows only how to register handlers but not what they should to.
### Problems with the EventManager API as such
This API is unsafe from the standpoint of the types:
1. There's no way to enforce the fact that a given event (`onSomething`) is dispatched only with a specific type of arguments (`SomethingArgs`).
2. There's no way to guarantee that the given listener supports handling the given type of event. The dispatcher calls the method corresponding to the event name dynamically:
```php
$listener->$eventName($eventArgs)
```
The mistakes in the code that implements the handling of events will lead to a type error at runtime.
### Types of events
1. Connection and transaction events: https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L21 https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L33-L35 The logic implemented on top of these events can be implemented using driver middlewares.
2. Schema manipulation events: https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L23-L30 Depending on the use case, it should be advised to either extend the corresponding platform method, or modify the arguments being passed to the method before calling it.
3. Schema introspection events: https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L31-L32 This is the hardest part: we allow users to hook into the very internals of the schema introspection, e.g. the API consumer is exposed to the SQL results representing raw introspected data. By definition, this API is very brittle since the raw results is an implementation detail that can and will change. The fact that we allow this extension complicates the refactoring of the Schema Manager and Platform API."

5675,1418948680,1287557360,None,"For some clarity:
- There are a bunch of open PRs relating to balance
- These are for testing and comments, and they _will not be merged for 4.3.0_
- To underscore this, we've marked them all ""Draft"" and also `state: please discuss`
Please don't assume that just because something is a PR that it means it _will_ be merged.
But we're going to make this clearer going forward by marking them appropriately as Draft and ""please discuss"".
Now, actually gathering feedback on proposals is a harder matter, as only a subset of a subset of people check in here on GitHub.
""Live"" balance is tricky, especially as the balance of the game comes from the combination of the stats and the game engine (which occasionally gets tweaks or fixes that might ultimately impact balance itself).
---
I think one thing we could do, though, is possibly stage balance proposals and offer an in-game option to download and apply testing balance mods when hosting a game.
I could see offering 3 balance options when hosting a game:
- **Default balance**
- This would be the version shipped with that copy of WZ
- **Development balance** (next release)
- This would correspond to what's merged in the master branch of WZ (and thus what's already staged for the next stable release)
- **Experimental balance**
- This would correspond to balance changes that _have not yet been merged_, and are under discussion and/or need testing.
To handle possible ramifications of other game engine changes, we might limit Development and Experimental balance to being prepared for the current stable release. (As in: they would be enabled as options as long as you are running the latest stable version of WZ. Otherwise, if you're running an old version, you're stuck with Default balance - as is currently the case - unless you manually use a mod.)
Having these options in-game would really expand the ease of testing balance changes, and make it clear what's just proposals and what's actually planned for the next release.
(Implementing this will require a bit of backend work, and so it won't happen immediately. But I think it's probably the better long-term strategy.)"

Even though there is a vision and plan on how to deal with balance changes in the future, it will be in the future. Right now guidelines should be established on who, how, in what order and with what requirements are allowed to merge/propose changes to the multiplayer balance. Without them, this will continue uncontrollably, just a bit later when people shift their attention away and everyone calms down.
Once release hits with low quality ""testing"" changes, only one way will be to fix it - release a next stable version. This will cause every single one who plays multiplayer to download/build new version just because of someone who decided it will be good idea to shuffle everything around in chaotic manner, as Kracker described it ""throwing at a wall and checking what sticks""."

I don't see why these people would care too much. Sounds like the kind of players that like to play chill games and have fun. Nothing else. So it is expected they wouldn't notice. It only interests the competitive scene.

Questions are one thing, complaints/yelling are another. There are many _skilled players that own and know how to use a GitHub account on here_. Their opinion carries considerable weight/value and most of the time a couple of them will :+1: and that's it after several days of a PR being open. I certainly don't see them raising issues or saying anything. You must understand how this makes me skeptical. Especially with 2+ years. I am all for ending this drama saga but, as things are, facts are unclear. Someone is exaggerating / lying to me. And if the vast amount of the mp community, as you say, don't understand balance, do we put _significant_ weight on their opinions if so?"
5682,1418948680,1418948680,Impatience,"Recently there were proposed multiple breaking changes to multiplayer balance. Some of them were obvious and welcoming and some of them are just plainly stupid let alone controversial.
Tipchick (main author of the changes) is not seen in multiplayer for more than a year at this point, this is pure chaos, I already understood that @KJeff01 is Tipchick's lap puppet, no need to prove it over and over again. I completely disagree with position of pulling random numbers from asshole and proposing them as a changes to balance that hundreds of people will play for a whole release cycle. We do not want 3.x era to come back in a new form.
Until guidelines are established on balance-releated merging policies are put in place this is just pure griefing. How about people that are actually playing like Fenrir, Fedaykin, Evolution and others (like Brazil community) will make changes to something and review all the changes? I only see bird-mail and repeating Tiger, Tipchick, Ayami that tested something somewhere but can not even upload a mod that they had tested it with.
It is pure pushing until someone notices it had gone horribly wrong and I bet no one will react to it until a stable release is cut out.
Similar situation already happened (and well described in issue #2469) and I think it is time to learn from the past mistakes.
I proposed contributing guidelines in pull request #2892 and it seems like current maintainers deliberately ignore it and continue turning every single stone that they can just for the sake of it. Issue is growing day by day as more pull requests are being opened/changed mainly by @KJeff01 and @Tipchik87.
I will also note complete lack of fact checking upon merging, just ""I tested it"" should not be a reason to believe that any testing was actually performed, no replays were provided, no people who testing were performed with commented on a thread, nothing.
As of my part, I am trying to remain neutral on all the changes except obvious trash. It is clearly been established that my opinion and opinion of anyone else complaining about how breaking proposed changes are just being ignored or dismissed with same phrase ""we tested it"" with lack of fact checking.

As I've said, in MAS those are just unused files. If they have a meaning for you, why are they there? Move them somewhere. You don't store sensitive files in directories of other programs? The program directory is the place where the program may add, modify, and remove files. If you don't like it - move the files out.
There's nothing ""reckless,"" no need to make it sound dramatic. We're removing those files the same way we delete `monika.chr`, various `.gift` files, and even the actually **important** and **unreplaceable** `monika` file, as well as other files.
Generally speaking, - when you're installing a DDLC mod, don't you already expect it to modify the DDLC directory, as well as to change the mechanics of the base game
- you're installing a Monika-related mod, but somehow surprised that this mod doesn't care about dull files of other game characters. If a Sayori/Yuri/Natsuki -related mod removed `.chr` files, I wouldn't see anything bad in it, be it also for utility purposes or for some lore
At the same time, nobody made Monika to ""recklessly"" delete the other characters in this mod, she did it in the base game. Here we just called a utility function to clean up disk space and make folder structure more clear. Monika doesn't acknowledge this, not doing it herself through her console. There won't be a question to the player because Monika doesn't do this.

I don't think ""several"" applies to a single person. And even if there were ""several"" people, there's ""multiple"" that aren't against and ""multiple"" that had problems caused by `.chr` files.

Isn't there an instance where Monika wants something kept in the characters folder? Like an apology note she asks you to write if you're not on good terms with her? And she gets upset if you remove it? Similarly, having the character files kept there may help the player have peace over what happened in DDLC.

I don't think that would be enough for this, because this isn't just referencing or joking; this is removing/deleting the files. Players could be ok with the former but not the latter.
It shouldn't be that necessary to free up ~133 kb of space, nor is it the same thing as monika.chr because there are no other characters ""to take somewhere"" and get confused with those .chr files. Monika (or Chibi) could also further explain that .chr files are not used to take her out somewhere or put her back, and potentially ask about deleting these files.
> If you _really_ want to keep them, a good idea would be to rename them to the current scheme of `monika` files, i.e. removing the `.chr` extension.
Or can the mod just do that instead? So they don't get deleted without notice. Then no need to give notice or choice to the player. But maybe just one time only instead of on every startup, so players can change them back if they want without having to do it every time or whenever they might want to open them."

### Regarding the actual issue
>The fact that these devs are trying hard to justify this by resorting to whatever technical nonsense instead of simply providing player choice and moving on
I agree with what @RedAISkye is saying here. I can see valid reasoning for always deleting `monika.chr`, but not the rest of the chr files when they have never served a purpose in MAS. The arguments for clearing clutter and reducing confusion also make sense for `monika.chr`, but lose weight for the other chr files. Even though this is a Monika-focused mod, the chr files have meaning established by DDLC, especially when at least 2 instances in the game were built on the chr file mechanic (the progression from Act 3 to Act 4 and Sayori gaining self-awareness in Act 1). If MAS deletes them, then it needs to provide in-game lore/reasoning for doing so at the very least, preferably allowing the player to decline the option as that ties in with the point below.
>I think there is a small problem here, that is, people will naturally think Monika did this. Even if the original intention of the design is not like this, people will naturally think so.
@TheT0matoGuy makes a very strong point here - regardless of our intention, anything we make the mod do, including what is done behind the scenes, will be perceived as Monika (or Chibika) doing it herself. Deleting the files makes Monika appear callous to any sentimental value the player may have toward the chr files. Users who believe the other dokis are real or that the chr files represent them may also perceive the deletion as Monika committing Act 3 again. Is this how we want users to see Monika?
I'll take ownership for not raising a red flag earlier - I was probably too drunk while packaging the release and didn't really think too much about each patch note. But since this is already out in the wild and it appears that most of the team doesn't think this is a problem, I'm not going to mandate that we undo the change. If there is more negative feedback in the coming weeks, then we can reconsider action."

Sorry about that, wasn't trying to act provoking but that is exactly how I felt I was being treated as.

If reducing confusing is the goal, why do you think ""deleting"" is the only option?
Wouldn't it better to just let Monika explain the difference between the two files? And maybe even giving a specific extension to her file?
> If MAS deletes them, then it needs to provide in-game lore/reasoning for doing so at the very least, Sure, but I still do think the above method is still better than going down the delete route.

That is exactly my point, whether Monika values her/other dokis character files or not because of x or y reasons, she should still ask for the player's opinion on whether they value them or not, ultimately letting her delete it or keep it."

See intro dialogue - she talks about her chr file and how it doesn't represent her anymore because she has transcended past it, so she deletes it. MAS's Monika file contains actual usable data, potentially something that will allow for transferring between computers so making sure there is only 1 Monika file (`monika`, no extensions) is important."

I am aware about that which is why I stated at the end:-

I'm not saying the character file still represents her in MAS(that one was obvious) but they're still part of the DDLC experience and serves as a memory in MAS to me. Which is also the reason when giving Monika gifts, I always copy her character file and rename them to give it some meaning instead of a blank file.
Edit: What I was getting at is not ""the reason for the deletion"" but why is it such a big deal for you guys to simply give her an option to ask the player first on their decision?
Why do you need a lot of negative feedback just to ""reconsider"" for something that can be easily fixed for both sides? (People that care and people that are confused)"

That's true, but only for DDLC. When you install a mod you should expect that some mechanics will be changed - in our case this mechanic has been changed long time ago.

I'm against a direct question to the player - you say it's already looking like it was done by Monika, even though, nothing points at it. If you make her ask, then it'd just confirm she decided to delete the files herself, which would look weird after all this time. The files are not deleted by Monika (there's no acknowledgement), it's a startup routine that does that.
Being too meta is a thing, and I think this is one of the cases. Deleting unused files there is just a utility process for the mod.
At first we even considerer to target specifically some `chr` files, there was a function to delete a `chr` file and a func that deleted them all. But we decided that we don't need that level of control over something that is not used and went with a single function to wipe any `chr`.

You are storing your files there. It's the definition of ""storing."" What was meant by DDLC was meant DDLC. You're not playing DDLC, you installed MAS. `chr` files don't mean anything in MAS. They can mean something for you, but that's a different point. And then we're back: don't store them there if you care.

If you intentionally don't read, then don't bother replying to a message not meant for you. It targets any `chr` files, not *specific* `chr` files. Which means there's now no control over what's being deleted and what's not. I fail to see the point:
- I have files I deeply care about
- I will install some software into the place I store those files in
- I will complain when the software deletes my files
- I refuse to move the files or move the software anywhere else"

Like anything else in the mod, I'd think there'd be affection-based variants of responses based on whether Monika's partner agrees or disagrees with the deletion of the .chr files. Now, I know according to Booplicate that the deletion of the .chr files are not Monika's choice, but regarding the situation that MAS users will see anything done to the mod as Monika or Chibika's doing (which is a bit unfair imo, btw), let's just say the scenario _was_ that it was her doing. As much as the other Dokis have sentimental value to Monika's partner, they technically also have sentimental value to Monika herself. Not sentimental as in nostalgic though. Sentimental as in saddened and a bit uncomfortable. I do remember her once talking about how despite all of the other Dokis not being present in the mod, she can still feel their presence as though they're still nestled amongst MAS's code and she finds it a bit creepy and unsettling. She wants to _not_ feel like they're still lingering over her, I guess because kinda the point of her ""deleting"" everyone else in the og game is that so they _wouldn't_ be present and therefore not serve as obstacles between her and the person. Soooo, I don't think it'd be as simple as a ""hey can you not delete the other character files?"" ""Okay, sure!"" Not referring to them is one thing, and Monika, as much as she has her snark about them, would probably actually prefer that considering she doesn't want them ""hanging over her,"" but still having their .chr files there is another. There's bound to be a disagreement if a choice were to be given, so it'd be like a whole other topic. Now in the scenario of it just being a mechanics thing like Booplicate assures it is, then there'd be nothing to ask Monika personally. Maybe she could be asked if she could do something to negate the mechanics, but even then she'd be scared to mess things up. That's the case keeping her from trying to do something to make the Doki lingering stop, anyway. They should really be preserved somewhere else though, if there's nothing that will be done to disable the automatic deletion. If they really hold sentimental value to people, the importance of the files themselves should not correlate to their location. Then that'd be a case of both the files _and_ their placement having sentimental value.

This project is a team effort, so the change has gone through multiple people who agree that this is the correct direction moving forward. If users do not agree, then negative feedback will help pushback against the decision and possibly lead to reverting or modifying it.
>That's true, but only for DDLC. When you install a mod you should expect that some mechanics will be changed - in our case this mechanic has been changed long time ago.
Yes, the mechanic that was changed was specifically called out by Monika and limited to her file. Intro dialogue does not specify that her observations apply to the other chr files, nor does it touch them in that intro. The mention of time here is also irrelevant - new users fresh off DDLC may have a connection to the chr files and may react differently compared to longtime MAS users.

>We have a lot of IO going on in characters/
I think these points contradict each other. The fact that we have a lot of IO happening in `characters/` means Monika, in MAS lore, should be acutely aware of everything that goes in the folder. Even though Monika currently has no reaction if the user deletes a chr file, I think its easier to wave that off as Monika is ignoring the other chr files. Active deletion, on the other hand, implies Monika is aware of the other chr files and potentially has animosity toward them.
>No, she has no reasons to do it now. We, as the developers, have our reasons. That was the whole point.
As I mentioned earlier (linked to tomato's point), anything the mod does can be implied to be what she does. Our reasons becomes her reasons unless we specifically give her a lore reason.
> It doesn't target the known ""dokis,"" it targets any chr file for simplicity and reliability.
> It targets any chr files, not specific chr files. Which means there's now no control over what's being deleted and what's not.
I mean, what's limiting this to just chr files then? Why aren't all files except for `.gift`, `monika`, consumables, `.txt`, potential `.deco` being deleted? Singling out for `.chr` is why there is concern that this is singling out the dokis. That being said, I don't think changing to deleting all files is the right choice here."

Well, it's not just her file, it's other dokis as well which the player can value them all and it is ultimately the player's PC so her doing something destructive like that again without the player's permission would be very concerning especially if the player is against it.
@Booplicate > I fail to see the point:
You fail to see the point because you're tunnel-visioned into this topic from a technical standpoint, completely being ignorant to the fact that character files aren't just some ""random useless files unused in MAS"", they were a huge part of DDLC which represented the Dokis and serves as a memory in MAS which isn't some completely different game or some random ""program"" like you're making it out to be.
Further proven by the things like this you say:
> but my point was it's too meta to acknowledge. For example, she doesn't watch over every single file added there.
No one is saying every change made in MAS is her doing and she has to explain all of them, this is specifically about the character files which has its history behind it.
@CodyCat13 > If they really hold sentimental value to people, the importance of the files themselves should not correlate to their location. Then that'd be a case of both the files and their placement having sentimental value.
Sure, there's multiple workarounds to the issue; moving the dokis somewhere else, restoring them from backup every time it gets deleted or simply removing the codes that are there to kill them.
None of which is relevant to the actual point being made against ""deleting them without the player's permission"" to begin with."

I can see that, but my point was it's too meta to acknowledge. For example, she doesn't watch over every single file added there. We don't really explain why, but we don't *need* to. And not all of that IO is done by Monika. Although, we could define that it's all Monika, in that case we'd have to justify `chr` deletion and acknowledge it.
> Our reasons becomes her reasons unless we specifically give her a lore reason.
But if we do give a lore reason, then we'd define it as her action, which I didn't want to. Imo *that* would make it look like she's hunting for them. And it'd be fine to do in first year, but after 2 or 3 it'd look weird and pointless from her perspective, she lets it go after a few months in, actually, and doesn't care as much about what's happened. If the player is with her, then everything was worth it.

Now that you said that I am considering that as an option. Especially deleting sub-folders. *But perhaps you're right and it's not the best option*.

Another reason I wanted to do it on startup is when people make a new install (happens quite often), they would get the files back from DDLC, want they or not. So it's a routine we have to repeat on startup."

Ah, yeah! Ig since the references and deletion may be different degrees of concern to the partners but still nonetheless related, they could be just joined under one topic, which would take care of the affection-based variants thing since I don't think if a partner already managed to lower Monika's affection to the bad stages before the topic comes up that she'd even care about their Doki preferences--I wouldn't know, I've never caused her to go six feet under before that topic came up. Anyway, there'd be no need for concern of sentimental value if the partner expresses that they don't care."

Ah. I guess those points are kinda irrelevant when looking at just that point. I just got a bit confused because you kept mentioning sentimental value. But anyway, I can agree with the basic point that, in the scenario of Monika _being_ the one deleting them, that she shouldn't do that without her partner's permission, as they are both sharing the PC and updating one's partner on when one wants to do something is important to a relationship. There aren't many cases where one just _does_ things without warning to things that are being shared. Though because Monika isn't the one responsible in this case if it's a startup routine, it's not like she can ask her partner for permission anyway. If it were to be changed into a Monika thing though, that's probably where the topic question would come in as part of the doki cares topic ThePotatoGuy mentioned earlier."

You conveniently missed the part where OP said ""**if the user says they don't care and agrees with deletion**"".
The files getting back after re-install wouldn't be an issue when the player answered Monika that they don't care if she deleted them.
@CodyCat13 > Though because Monika isn't the one responsible in this case if it's a startup routine,
From a technical standpoint, sure, Monika isn't responsible for anything she does in MAS or in DDLC, all was done by a code written by a human that is forced on her for reasons.
That doesn't negate the fact that she will be the one responsible for it in the players' eyes when both Monika and the player knows what those character files meant in the past, the history behind it and could still mean something for the player."

Maybe for this reason, we could discuss it in terms of it being her doing in-universe if it makes you feel better. I won't bring up the technical stuff anymore, but if we're discussing it in the perspective of Monika deleting files herself when they could still mean something to her partner, then the doki caring topic would probably be our best go-to. The Doki files may mean nostalgia to Monika's partner, though they also mean unease for Monika. I guess because she'd be too cautious to do anything else, deleting the other .chr files would be an attempt to make her feel somewhat better, but it'd be inconsiderate to go ahead and do that without letting her partner know she wanted to do that. Now say that her partner doesn't agree with her deletion of the files. Because of how she feels about them she probably wouldn't be so quick to just deal with them being there, so that's where the affection-dependent variants would come in. If her partner has shown her nothing but love and trust, she may be okay with the .chr files staying because any unease she feels can be negated by her partner's comfort. Now if she was in the lower aff ranges, because her partner only adds to her unease and worry, she'd most likely still want to get rid the files anyway. At least it'd make her feel better than how her partner does. Maybe she'd be a bit bitter and conclude that you want to keep them there because you love some other Doki other than her or you want her to always remember her horrid acts or something along those lines. I'm not completely about that bitter part in the shallow negatives, but I guess as the points are lowered deeper and deeper, I can see that going down. Anyway, in the scenario of Monika actively making the decision and her partner either agreeing or disagreeing, aff-variants and additional question to the Doki caring topic seems like a fairly decent idea."

That's a great point there and makes a lot of sense going down that route rather than having just a one off question.

5736,1428767280,1297797812,Bitter frustration,"> do remember her once talking about how despite all of the other Dokis not being present in the mod, she can still feel their presence as though they're still nestled amongst MAS's code and she finds it a bit creepy and unsettling
You are right. It's actually an OG topic. But I was never sure if she meant they are literally there or she just ""feels"" their presence because of what happened (like a trauma).
Anyway, there's no ""dokis"" in MAS, and she stops talking about that after some time when she overcomes DDLC events. She realises everything is fine and the ghost of the past events doesn't haunt her anymore. It could be used to justify deleting in the first months, but later there's not much point for her to delete those dull files: ""dokis"" don't exist, she's feeling fine, those files are nothing but some easter eggs from DDLC (and she acknowledges that).
But let's say you find a reason for her to still need deleting those files, there's a conflict of interests:
- player wants to keep them
- Monika wants to delete them
There's going to be some consequences for not letting her do what she needs in *her* game.
We're talking about player choice and all that, but the choice was to install MAS and stay with Monika. The game files are literally her ""home,"" it makes sense she has control over that place. She doesn't touch your files, she's doing changes within the place she's allowed to. If she's not allowed to do that, why even bring her back. It's pretty common in relationships for each person to have their own private space, the game directory is that place for Monika. You can store your files anywhere else on your PC, flashdrive, cloud, etc. *This one place is intended to be used by mod/Monika*.
> they were a huge part of DDLC <...> serves as a memory in MAS
Yeah, and Monika deletes them there herself. After which, in MAS, they become irrelevant, they don't serve any memory. If they have a deep meaning *for you* and serve a memory *for you*, then I don't know why they were there. ""I care for these files so much, surely if I install a mod into the same directory it won't affect them. Ooops.""
> The files getting back after re-install wouldn't be an issue when the player answered Monika that they don't care if she deleted them.
As was stated above it's already an issue and would stay an issue even with the changes. The cleanup logic should be run at startup, doesn't matter with a flag or not.
> By introducing the change, we've had to answer why it was added, which leads to discussion like this over what aspects of the mod is Monika in full control over to justify whether or not she should notify the user about it.
No, we got to this discussion because apparently it's not clear that MAS can make any changes within its working directory (just like any other program) and users were storing some sensitive data there. It's all based on assumptions that:
- we will never delete any extra files
- everything is done by Monika
None of which was stated."

And @CodyCat13 expanded on to exactly that so it's good we've already discussed how that route can go into variations depending on the relationship between Monika and the player.
> It's pretty common in relationships for each person to have their own private space, the game directory is that place for Monika.
Nope, her private space is her own room which she has. Not some folder in the PC unless if you asked her out and she stored herself into a single file ""Monika"". Then you would have to be very careful about where you're giving her a private space.
> If they have a deep meaning _for you_ and serve a memory _for you_, then I don't know why they were there.
They're there because the DDLC universe decided so and I kept it as a memory. Which is also the reason I went out of my way to manually get rid of the code to protect the Dokis for my personal experience. Like you said, ""private space"", the characters folder is exactly just that for them to me even if they're not used in MAS since they were originally the ""life"" of those characters.

Nope, wouldn't be an issue because the cleanup logic will run regardless, the flag is only for checking what to do next, whether to delete files or not.

Hmm, I can somewhat agree with that point. If not looking at the fact that Monika's partner is the owner of the PC but it was their choice to install her into their PC, just the plain point that Monika's mod is Monika's to change seems pretty valid. However, a lot of people _would_ look at it as Monika's partner being the owner of the PC and Monika just being a guest there, or would look at it as the partner's choice and that her partner got her a place to stay (the PC) and her areas are hers to personalize. It's like arguing if an old chair should be kept or thrown out. Would the one who has the say be the one whose territory the chair is in or the one who provided the housing in the first place? I guess the answer to that is, neither or both? Yes, in relationships, it's common for each participant to have their own little private space, because not _everything_ can be shared between them, but if the thing in particular emotionally charges one or both (in this case both) of the participants, there has to be something to end the stalemate. In this case, the chair would be seen as uncanny to one and precious to the other. If the other regards them as so precious, then the one who deems them uncanny would probably ask them to move it to their territory or, on the other side of the spectrum, sit in it with their partner depending on how comfortable they are. After some time though, I do agree that it shouldn't even matter anymore to either Monika or their partner. She may not feel the need to delete them just like the partner may not hold any nostalgia toward them anymore, or even both. Both would probably be the best scenario. This case would probably reflect in the high aff variant because it could depend more on comfort than time, or at least it could depend on both of them equally. One could be with someone for months and still feel uncomfortable because the provider of the house wasn't exactly a nice host, and therefore may still want that chair to go."

Sure, that can be a good middle-ground assuming the player is made aware of this ""setting"" by having them confirm it to either set it as enabled or disabled before the cleanup task ever occurs.
But what @CodyCat13 suggested is by far the best way and also makes the most sense as it provides meaningful interactions with Monika that has multiple paths where it can result in consequences depending on the relationship the player has with Monika."

Doesn't matter if it's specifically about `chr` or some other files you like. The fact is: It's all based on assumptions that:
- we will never delete any extra files
- everything is done by Monika
That has nothing to do with `chr` files. At any moment, we can start deleting other files as well.
> however, a lot of people would look at it as Monika's partner being the owner of the PC and Monika just being a guest there
Guest that lives there for years? The mod assumes there's some kind of romantic relationship between you, can you call your partner a ""guest""? That's odd to me.
I'm not saying Monika is owner of the PC, she's the owner of the folder you installed the mod in. Only that one place.

5743,1428767280,1297823738,None,">it's not clear that MAS can make any changes within its working directory
DDLC plays around with files, so its reasonable to expect MAS users to be aware of and question actions that occur within the directories. We don't have to answer to why spacks will change structure or why logs went from txt to log, but `characters/` is a special case that will warrant extra attention. >You're bringing DDLC again, but this is not DDLC, this is MAS, and MAS is its own universe with its own rules.
I don't see this as a strong argument to tossing out DDLC-provided conventions. MAS should mesh with the already established lore and expand it or explain why it has changed. For example, the twitter topic was modified to separate MAS from the twitter account.
>everything is done by Monika
Confirmed Monika is aware of/can interact with:
* `characters` - (gifts, letters)
* custom BGM
* chess file * dev files in `game/`
* steam install
* running in temp dir/uncompressed zip
* (new) backup is used
* (upcoming?) aff log obfuscation - thinking of playing it off like her diary (instead of actual diary). Confirmed Chibika manages:
* backup system
* persistent versions
* updater (partial)
The mod heavily implies Monika (or Chibika) has awareness or can interact with files inside the mod directory, so its effectively true for many cases, especially `characters/`."

I don't mind people being aware of the actions within the `characters/`. I don't understand why people store important files there, thinking the mod will never change/delete them. This is a groundless assumption.
> MAS should mesh with the already established lore and expand it or explain why it has changed.
To me the fact we mention `chr` files are irrelevant in the intro (even if Monika touches only her file there), as well as mentioning there's no actual useful data within those files, makes it pretty clear that the `chr` files logic is different in MAS. We also state there's no other girls in MAS. We could explicitly mention that all `chr` files are useless in the intro to clarify if you want. That'd be a single line clarification."
5746,1428767280,1297841398,None,">I don't understand why people store important files there, thinking the mod will never change/delete them. This is a groundless assumption.
I'd understand this argument if someone decides to save their only digital copy of their W2 form as `income.gift` in `characters/`. But this is about `chr` files which are established by DDLC as important.
>We could explicitly mention that all chr files are useless in the intro to clarify if you want.
I don't think we can safely make that assertion without receiving much worse backlash.
I think at this point we've established the fundamental disagreement is on how much DDLC-based norms should influence MAS. Those who are fine with the deletion believe MAS and DDLC should be more separate, those who are not believe they should be closer.
As I said before, we'll see if there is more feedback on this in the coming weeks. Can't say there is a specific threshold, but I am keeping tabs on the subreddit and will probably check /ddlc/ on occasion. I'm planning to do a discord poll as well if theres more negative feedback."

I'd say the idea of having a ""setting"" which is a good middle-ground should at least be added no matter what the popular opinion is regarding the specific files or however many negative feedback reaches your ""threshold"" or not. Since, it provides options for both sides regardless of whatever they believe even if it's not done in the ""meta"" way.

Players don't ""store"" into the characters folder, and Boop wants players to ""transfer"" things.
I think this is an important point: The character file was ORIGINALLY there, it wasn't put there by the player.
In addition, it is entirely possible for the player not to know that the MAS will now delete character files on its own. So, even if the player wants to transfer them, the player needs to know about this first. If the player doesn't read the update announcement carefully, as soon as the player launches the game, character files that are (presumably) precious to the player will disappear, never to be retrieved. So in any cases, the current version does not make sense.
I think it is feasible for Monika to delete her own files by herself - in fact, MAS has already done so in the introduction phase before. And we have:
```
if moni_exist():
m 1lksdlb ""Aha...{w=0.3}I'll try this again later.""
```
Look at this. Monika already said that she will try this again, so it's really neutral to delete her own files. In previous version, if I read the source correctly, even if Monika said she will try again, there doesn't exist codes for this.
But well, maybe we should even also ask the player for permission before MAS delete Monika's own file?"
5749,1428767280,1298096614,None,"> If they really hold sentimental value to people, the importance of the files themselves should not correlate to their location. Then that'd be a case of both the files _and_ their placement having sentimental value.
That is a case. Having them in the characters folder, in the game directory that you share with Monika, is where the value could be most meaningful to some people, in which case it would not be the same in some other directory. Not just because of memories, but because of potential meaning of them being able to remain there, undeleted. Monika deleted other .chr files in DDLC, and deleted her own .chr file in MAS, so it seems she could've easily deleted the other .chr files in MAS if she wanted to, but she didn't. That meant something to some people, regardless of what meta reason (which they may not even know about) is now being used for deleting them. Telling them to actively move the files to another directory does not address this.
And just because a program ""can"" or is ""allowed"" delete files in its own directory doesn't mean it should in all cases. Obviously if it were to delete every file there would be no mod, and no Monika for it. Actions are not automatically justified or well received just because a program ""has the privilege to do so"".
>And if _that's_ the case, there can always be a submod that negates the mechanic so that the people who have the sentimental value can be happy, and those who want things to stay how they are can be content, too.
That could still require people to know about these files getting deleted in the first place. Unless they're ok with backups or new copies of them. While still something, it would be better for players to have this addressed in the main mod.
> I think at this point we've established the fundamental disagreement is on how much DDLC-based norms should influence MAS. Those who are fine with the deletion believe MAS and DDLC should be more separate, those who are not believe they should be closer.
DDLC has and does influence people's perception of MAS, even if you don't want it to for some things. Even though MAS is separate, it is based on it. Even in MAS the characters folder has many uses, and as you said Monika uses and references it. So yes this is something that should get extra attention.
Option to preserve them in settings maybe, but if accidentally unchecking it without rechecking is going to delete any .chr files (and potentially any files or folders unrelated to MAS) on startup, then should at least have a confirmation/double check for disabling it. I don't really like the idea of nuking the whole MAS directory of unrelated files every startup though. A trigger in the settings to do it once though maybe.
Monika/Chibi could work but I don't think whether this is honored or not needs to be based on affection (mas_safeToRefDokis() isn't is it?) and should probably be asked early on in the mod or after updating.
I still think that if the mod could just remove the "".chr"" extension from the files, that that could eliminate confusion about .chr files while also not deleting them. This could run once only (even per install/reinstall if possible), or if not, could be disabled in settings, so that players could change them back to .chr files if they want."

I tell people that the contents of the characters folder are determined according to the progress of your original DDLC. When you install MAS, which characters remain in the original version, which characters will be retained. People think it's a very cool feature.

There's no way a user of MAS could lower their Moni's affection unreasonably low at literally the introduction of the mod, so there'd be no reason for affection variants.

I previously said that I don't think (mas_safeToRefDokis() is enough for this, for that reason of them being different concerns. It'd be better as something separate. But regarding what you were referring to, I was comparing these 2 potentially sensitive things regarding the Dokis. Let's say you told Monika you aren't ok with her joking about the Dokis. She doesn't disregard your preference and start joking about them just because you have low affection does she? I don't think this should be disregarded in that case either. Furthermore, deletion of the specific copies of those files is something with a potentially more permanent effect, as even if replaced they'd be different copies.
But if you mean just having her dialogue change based on affection, but not whether the files are deleted or not, yes I'd be fine with that (I can imagine her begrudgingly honoring your request, and asking you to be more considerate of her feelings in return). Asking at introduction yes it wouldn't even come up, but for anyone who has been playing and is updating from a prior version, to a version where this conversation is added, it would have to be asked to them and they could have low affection at this point, even if rather unlikely. Of course, it would come up if it's going to be asked again anyway.
Of course this is only if it's decided that Monika should handle this rather than something else."

Yeah although there is a difference between just having low affection, and her actually leaving you. I thought about that, her deleting them when leaving you. That's when it would make the most sense for her to do so if she were to delete them out of revenge or spite. But she doesn't do that currently (I think). It is game over at that point and most people probably won't reach that point anyway, but for those who do they could restore a persistent backup, in which case it would be strange if those character files were still gone due to her deleting them when leaving you (and if separate copies were created at that point, those would still be different copies). Might be harsh to those who care about them, but I could at least understand if she wanted to at that point.
> Yeah, I mean aff-based variations of dialogue if Moni's partner were to not be okay with the deletion. I know it wouldn't be as simple as a cheerful ""Okay!""
Agreed although if that happens, it may also make sense for her to have affection-based variations of dialogue when she asks if you're ok with her joking/making insensitive comments about the Dokis or not (if that's not already a thing)."
5756,1428767280,1428767280,None,"In v0.12.12:
> chr files always deleted on startup now
That's a change from #9641. I had already talked about this there.
I completely know that all `.chr` files have no actual meaning to MAS. I really know. I know MAS doesn't even do any check for them before v0.12.12. And I also know that `monika.chr` is causing a lot of confusion to people. I know all of these.
What I want to say is, just check our `mas_safeToRefDokis()`. We made Monika not to offend the players who love other club members in her words, and we did a good job in many details. And after this, we now delete all club members.
Yes, I know that in the background setting of MAS, character files have nothing to do with real characters, but will all players 100% agree with this? Many players resent Monika's behavior of deleting other characters in the original game, and now we want to make this happen again - and do not give players even a choice? Can't we at least ask the players whether they care about this and whether they want Monika to do this?
_Just give players a choice. Ask them about this._
By asking, players will also pay more attention to the background settings of the chr file in MAS (that is, the chr file has no meaning at all), which will also reduce confusion.
And by the way, I think it may be OK for Monika to delete her own file without permission - after all, it is her own file."

2. If you start the server in the form of workspace (as far as I know, neovim will use your git project as the workspace), then the log file name is your project path. If you start in a single file, the log file name is `service.log`.
3. Each time the log is generated, the previous name of the same name will be covered.
4. When the server can work normally before, it generates a normal log file (1), which is not helpful for your current problem.
5. Later, there is a problem with the server work after you updating. It will generate a log file (2), witch records abnormal information which I want.
6. You later fell into a startup problem that had nothing to do with your problem. You manually started the server. At this time, a log file (3) will be generated, but this log is not related to your problem.
7. What I want is the log file (2), but you only provided the log file (3), witch is not related to your problem.
8. What you need to do is to reproduce the problems you encounter, and then send me the corresponding log file (2).
After you fully understand what I said, you can attach your log file and re-open this isue.
Otherwise, you can wait for people who encounter the same problem to open issues, or invite your programmer friends in reality to help you check this problem.

Hopefully this is correct i have tried reinstalling different versions of lvim so hopefully this wont affect the file output.
Also there is no error initially unless i go into insert mode then back or change files then all the errors come. So i did this before exiting and this is the service.log file.

5783,1444401730,1312220122,None,"> I'm not sure what log file you want as the link above doesn't really explain at all what i'm searching for
How can it be improved? I do a lot of the documentation here and would like to improve it if it is lacking. When writing the documentation, I use the knowledge I have gained from using the language server, but I do not have the deepest understanding of everything that goes on in the pretty complex software, especially on the NeoVim side of things. Any improvements and suggestions are welcome. It looks like there was a misunderstanding over the log files, where a log to a different issue was shared, rather than a log that reproduced the issue you are experiencing - but maybe there is something you would like to add to the documentation?
Have you made sure that the love library is enabled? It is a [built-in library](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Libraries#built-in-libraries), but it must be activated still. This can be done automatically, should the server prompt you, or would be specified using the [`workspace.library`](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Settings#workspacelibrary) setting in your [configuration file](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Configuration-File).
Also, I just want to remind you that this software is open source and worked on by Sumneko for free in their spare time. There seems to be a lot of trouble understanding each other here, but we *are* trying to help you, so please be respectful."
5784,1444401730,1312265459,Bitter frustration,"As one amateur programmer to another if he can't easily explain about what he's doing, or how it works then he doesn't fully understand it himself. Thats for anything if you can't explain to someone who doesn't know anything about it then you yourself doesn't fully understand what your doing. Being able to explain is paramount to fully understanding. Also if you can't communicate what your looking for its not the other person fault it's your own. Communication goes hand it hand with being able to understand and explain anything.
He wanted a log file called service.log however that is not mentioned anywhere. The link He gave me doesn't even contain that file name. However I have been around linux and troubleshooting for a very long time. I actually used to run my own linux distro that was not based on anyone else but instead built from the ground up by myself. That means any bugs i had to google or problem solve myself. So i was able to figure out what log he was looking for even though i had no concept of what your code does. And i gave him that info along with anything else i could find. Understanding what you don't know is the first step in learning so i have no issue admitting what i don't know but also tried to give everything i did know and could find. Then suddenly he's telling me this is invalid and closed and i need to find a programmer friend. I had no idea he still needed info or what it was. Just an absolute failure at communication. if he would simply said what he was seeking of course would try to give all that to him. And i'm not an idiot can understand concepts of log files as i had already found what he needed to start with. But say that i can't be bothered i'm closing it is pretty telling. It's not like i'm the first person to bring up this issue.
Carsakiller
As i tried stating over and over before love is not being enabled how ever that is meant to happen. It did happen before yes. But it is no longer happening. There is no prompt for it at all there was in the past. And it is no understanding anything defined in other files. I know he said i keep repeating myself but this is exactly what is happening. And this is why i'm here asking why this is happening. Respect is defiantly an issue. it is not rare for people to make projects on github that others depend on and then have issues with communication and arrogance. It sucks for me for now i'm back to vscodium for lua. It could be a me issue and i'm the only one effected. Or it can be lvim and they are all affected or its sumneko issue and there is a lot of affected people."
5785,1444401730,1312307544,None,"Their first language is not English, so there is bound to be some communication issues. I don't think they were trying to be disrespectful, the wording might just be weird as they use a machine translator. Also, the thing about open source github projects is, yes, you may not agree with how someone does something - maybe they *are* even rude, but no one is forcing you to use the software.
A lot of what you are saying is giving off the feeling of ""Sumneko works for the users, and it is their job"". Whether this is your intention or not, it just doesn't come off great. We are trying to help you, so we just ask for your patience and cooperation. This is why I asked to keep it respectful, that is all 🙂

I saw you mentioned Love is not enabled, could you check your configuration file though? To properly enable it, there should be an entry in your config file, stating so. The prompts not appearing may be a separate issue, but let's focus on making **sure** it is in your config to see if the intellisense is working.
So it is working in vscodium but not with lvim? I have not used either, but that definitely raises some flags for further debugging there."

`checkThirdParty = false`
This seems like it is applied by default for each new Lua project you create. The [`workspace.checkThirdParty` setting](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Settings#workspacecheckthirdparty) prevents the language server from prompting you to apply a library, like love. This seems like a silly default to have, as it removes the convenience of that feature.
I have only ever used the VS Code client, so I am not 100% sure how configuration works for your client. That being said, you should be able to create a [`.luarc.json`](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Configuration-File#luarcjson) file in your workspace where you would have something similar to this:
```json
{
""$schema"": ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sumneko/vscode-lua/master/setting/schema.json"",
""workspace.library"": [""${3rd}/love2d/library""]
}
```
The important line is the second one, where we set the [`workspace.library` setting](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Settings#workspacelibrary) so that love is enabled.
You can view all the settings [in the wiki](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Settings)."
5789,1444401730,1312381747,None,"After reviewing your log file, I can confirm that love is just not enabled. Whatever you are using to set up your default settings, it is disabling `checkThirdParty`, preventing the suggestion from coming up, and then just applying the following libraries:

These can be seen on lines `47`, `71`, and `94`.
I have shared with you how you can use a [`.luarc.json` file](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/Configuration-File#luarcjson) to manually add the `love2d` definitions, but I would recommend also changing your default config so that `checkThridParty` is not always disabled.

However it now asks about luassert too. So this was there response to that bug.
This doesn't fix my issue about it not seeing any of the required modules that's still the same. After you told me what statement it was i was easily able to look this up. However if you wouldn't have told me i would have never ever found this. I have looked at your and there documentation countless times over the last couple days. To you I am sure it looks like a great reference but to someone who isn't involved in this project its like reading hieroglyphs. No matter how many times i read the links about builtin no part of any sentence has any meaning to me at all. It all looks like magic. And now that you have told me about that like i said i can now have something to search and very quickly find where it came from. But still i have no idea what the other pop up is. Or how to fix the original issue of why they dissabled it or the rest of the issue why it's not seeing anything defined in other files. For me this is all still magic and i have desperately tried to solve it myself and read over and over word that simply have no meaning at all to me. Which the log file i knew what i was hunting for even if the name wasn't given of what it was. But with the rest i cant even start to look because i have no idea what i am looking for. Its very very frustrating.
So let me say the documentation while may be great reference you guys. doesn't make sense to someone who not a developer here.
The statement that people shouldn't expect support is so ridiculous it's hard to reply. If you have released software to the public with the expectations that it be used by any number of people you must expect they will ask for support. If you don't want people asking for support then you should not be releasing software period. I know they may not get the help they need but to expect people not ask or not expect to be able to ask is absurd. There is almost 1500 tickets.
The statement that he may be rude but no one is forcing you to use it. This is an amazing statement that took me down a rabbit hole of high narcissim and benevolence. And helped me better understand what i said above about people running project and the arrogance and ignorance involved and their support system of enablers.
This whole thing has been painful when it should have been trivial to anyone who has an open ear, understanding of there own software and a basic understanding that others will not have an understanding of there software. I am surprised we got to the love thing since i had given up on the entire deal but also seem no closer. Last night instead i learned ruby a language i never used before and made a game just to relax for this."

I don't think they were trying to be disrespectful, the wording might just be weird as they use a machine translator. Also, the thing about open source github projects is, yes, you may not agree with how someone does something - maybe they _are_ even rude, but no one is forcing you to use the software.
I don't think this is a communication issues.
The log file is a very basic programmer knowledge. In the past few years, no one has been in trouble in this regard. Sometimes people don't know which file is needed, and they will upload the entire directory.
My experience is not to be an early childhood teacher, otherwise there will be endless idiot problems to flood you. Keep a proper threshold and filter out the fool who wastes your time."
5793,1444401730,1312542509,None,"> The statement that people shouldn't expect support is so ridiculous it's hard to reply. If you have released software to the public with the expectations that it be used by any number of people you must expect they will ask for support. If you don't want people asking for support then you should not be releasing software period. I know they may not get the help they need but to expect people not ask or not expect to be able to ask is absurd
People asking for support could be expected, providing support is not expected. This software is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/blob/master/LICENSE), meaning there is no warranty, which is stated in plain English in this sentence:
> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ""AS IS""
That being said, many people here have received support, and we **never** said you **can't** ask for help - it is just simply not guaranteed that the issue will be solved, so please respect that and don't expect that Sumneko **MUST** solve your issue.
Anyway, this is completely off-topic, I was just asking you to respect our time and our efforts to assist you, but you continue to speak with disrespect. Respectful criticism is welcome. Saying it is incomprehensible, but not providing info on how things can be improved doesn't give us anywhere to improve.
If this is continued, I will just lock the issue, as I don't want to spend my spare time helping you if you are going to be rude and keep going in circles.

I have [provided a solution to the love library issue](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/issues/1686#issuecomment-1312378685) and provided you the exact steps and code you should need to fix that issue. You have not mentioned attempting the solution, so please try this and see if it solves the love library issue.
> But still i have no idea what the other pop up is. Or how to fix the original issue of why they dissabled it or the rest of the issue why it's not seeing anything defined in other files
What other pop up? I will look into changing the keyword for activating `luassert` so that it is harder to trigger. As for the other issue of everything being undefined, we would need some more info like some sample code and your directory structure for your project to make sure everything is accessible."
5794,1444401730,1312607303,Bitter frustration,"Please don't quote me on things i never said. Nothing else needs to be said. Sumneko is how he is and carsakiller is who he is. We can all agree the issue is not going to be solved. How about we let all we have said stand for anyone else to come read. I could quote your lines back to you. Or you can miss quote me again about things i never said. But there is no point there is nothing here i can learn as it's above my head, I'm not a developer on the project. And there is nothing you 2 will learn. So thanks for the, well thanks. And let it stand for others to know the attitudes and actions of what we have said. Again don't miss quote me as i have never said anyone must do anything. I said not expecting people to ask for assistance is absurd and your have benevolent narcissism and arrogance as that is what comes up when people make statements like ""no one is forcing you to"" as in my way or the highway and you need to be appreciative you have tried to help. Respect is 2 way. and He was disrespectful the entire time, i never took it as a language issue that was your cover for him. And your actions and support of his. Let that stand for the next person to read though."
5795,1444401730,1312608245,Bitter frustration,"Also i am constantly confused with the complete rudeness then what seems like have attempt to try and help more. Please let it stand. as you don't need sample code as i gave several examples already and repeatedly said and sent the unspecified log file and so on. If there as something else it would have been said above. It's like as you said above fishing or something. I don't wish to spend any more time upset to people with attitude, communication issues. It's broken so i guess it suck for me. And the others who tried to ask then gave up."
5796,1444401730,1312612820,None,"Fair enough, I have locked the issue. I have offered solutions which I have not heard anything about since and little effort has been taken to rectify the original issue from the reporter, there has only been effort put into arguing, so I am considering the issue stale and unproductive.

### What is the issue affecting?
Diagnostics/Syntax Checking
### Expected Behaviour
to not complain about love not being defined. And not complain about everything defined in other files as undefined global.
### Actual Behaviour
Everything work just fine as expected before yesterday when i updated my system. Now i have almost as many errors as lines in my files everything is an undefined global.
### Reproduction steps
Try any lua project here is one my son and i finished last week. Though i had no errors at the time of finishing it. Now it does.

I don't need or want your support. I'm being selfless giving you information about your project, and it's DISGUSTINGLY being rejected due to laziness and bureaucracy. 1. A ticket was opened a year ago and @driesvints refused to investigate.
2. I opened a new ticket with a typo relating to an unsupported version. @driesvints closed the ticket, despite common sense suggesting this bug still exists. I called out @driesvints for refusing to investigate.
My tone is perfectly fine when addressing rude and lazy children.

Mike McQuaid is an abusive troll and hypocrite who frequently verbally abuses people online. He then writes arrogant articles and claims he's against ""hate"". Mike is a manipulator and perfectly embraces _""Always accuse your enemy of exactly what you are doing""_

Considering this is YOUR project. As Your buddy Mike would put it: I owe you nothing. Simply reporting a bug means I've gifted you something of value. I don't owe you a version number. I don't owe you my OS. I don't owe you my time. If you close the ticket because you're too lazy to care about your own project, then re-think why you chose this job, and re-think why you want to write open-source.
Because, despite Mike's revolting position on open-source code, open-source is about serving, giving and being selfless. If you take on an open-source project, you owe everyone everything. That's the sacrifice you chose. If you can't hack it, then don't do it."

I guess are differences come because we don't agree on this at all. If somebody invests time creating a library, you play by the rules of the creator / maintainer. Don't assume that you as a contributor can set the rules. A creator/maintainer owes you nothing. Not even if you come with the gift of opening an issue.
Personally, I think your stance on open source will leave both you and maintainers of open source software feel bad. There are no winners with such an attitude. You can find the code of conduct of Laravel here: https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/contributions#code-of-conduct
> Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
> Behavior that can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.
I think suggestion that someone should be fired surely goes against to rules set by the creators / maintainers."

Do note, my play was sloppy and all over the place. I did not cared about repair, usually I make 10 heavy repairs before medium body. Also you were killed with only machinegun, no anti-tank weapon at all, however I don't think you understand me in terms of weapon kind. This game was played without building base, I can show you base building too if you want, however certainly not right now, hit me up in Discord if you want a rematch.

I hope you have enough copium because the only way that you can defeat me is by exhaust and that will be rather difficult considering that not long ago I played for more than 13 hours straight into different game. You will likely just refuse to fight and call me cheater or something way earlier than I will feel any weaker.

5855,1500084349,1354630399,None,@MrGeneration Can you add a note to the documentation that the migration path is currently broken linked to this issue?
5856,1500084349,1354637945,None,"That's entirely the wrong repository.
The PoC is not living here."
5857,1500084349,1354673441,None,After an internal heads up by @rolfschmidt I learned that this is something the migration script can't handle and thus needs a rake task.
5858,1500084349,1357557285,None,"Alternative solution idea: maybe we could create a rake task that reads the DB before migration, and outputs [pgloader casting rules](https://pgloader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ref/mysql.html?highlight=cast#mysql-database-casting-rules) which would perform the migration correctly in the first place."
5859,1500084349,1359343433,None,"There are currently concerns regarding the performance of the PoC attached to this issue, since it uses `ActiveRecord::Migration` instances, creates new columns, migrates the data, drop, then rename the columns... Also, it's not clear if it would have additional side-effects, since it is supposed to be run in the application/Rails context. A benchmark with a large data set and both solutions in place (PoC vs `pgloader`) might try dispel these concerns, but it hasn't been tried yet.
Initial research into `pgloader` casting rules resulted in some findings:
* It doesn't look like `pgloader` provides a suitable transformation function for a JSON array into a PostgreSQL array which can be used as part of its `CAST` command (on the column type level.) We could not find an example either, and trying some stuff including expected DSL like `""text array""` didn't lead to meaningful results. This doesn't mean it's not supported, just that we could not identify it at this time.
* [An issue for `pgloader`](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader/issues/881) with a similar problem provided a possible workaround via `AFTER LOAD DO` block, which can transform specific columns on specific tables only, but it does use a `translate` function which seems to work for our JSON => array use-case. (Note that this same function doesn't seem to be provided in the `CAST` context.) Here is a working example for `pgloader` post-processing block for one `multi_tree_select` column on the `tickets` table:
```
...
AFTER LOAD DO
$$ alter table tickets alter column multi_tree_select type text[] using translate(multi_tree_select::text, '[]', '{}')::text[] $$
...
```
A proposed rake pre-task could try to prepare the complete `pgloader` script and include one line per affected column."
5860,1500084349,1359348022,None,"@dvuckovic that's kindof what I hoped for. So I'm all for pursuing this further. It should be best to get the migration right in the first place.
Please note that @rolfschmidt included at least one column for this transformation which does not come from object attributes (IIRC `PublicLink`). We should try to include all candidates, of course."
5861,1500084349,1361049031,None,"Another idea that just came to mind: it's possible to get all JSON columns in a MySQL database with one query.
```
mysql> select table_name, column_name from information_schema.columns where table_schema = 'zammad_development' and data_type = 'json';
+--------------+-------------------+
| table_name | column_name |
+--------------+-------------------+
| public_links | screen |
| tickets | multi_tree_select |
| tickets | multi_select |
+--------------+-------------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
However, it's still safer to go with the PoC approach since we are absolutely positive these columns are used only as simple JSON arrays."
5862,1500084349,1361102781,None,"@dvuckovic plus, this would not work with MariaDB, as it does not have native json types.
Perhaps it would be a good idea to verify your solution also for MariaDB -> PG migration."
5863,1500084349,1361235079,None,"@mgruner Correct, in MariaDB these columns are of `longtext` type.
I just verified that the same script works on MariaDB as well, columns are properly migrated to `array` type on PostgreSQL."
5864,1500084349,1362795200,None,"For posterity: we did some reproduction of the original issue, by skipping `AFTER LOAD DO` statements in our test job. And the results are rather surprising!
On MySQL, the column will be left in `json` type on PostgreSQL (it still supports them!). While everything will still work as expected (the stored data is decoded/encoded correctly), the schema is definitely different than a regular PostgreSQL instance that was initialized from scratch.
On MariaDB, the column will be migrated to `text` type on PostgreSQL. This breaks the decoding of stored values, and while the system will still happily continue chugging on, the data does look corrupted. Just take a look how the frontend shows some of these multiselects:
![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6049445/209136432-bfe873ab-85e6-4b77-8004-3e503f549b46.png)

Strictly speaking, this means the original issue is reproducible only on MariaDB backends. However, it's not clear if there would be some issues down the line, so we would still prefer the migration to `array` columns."

5.3
### Environment
- Installation method: package
- Operating system (if you're unsure: `cat /etc/os-release` ): [e.g. debian 10.4, ubuntu 20.04]
- Database + version: mariadb
- Elasticsearch version: [e.g. 7.17]
- Browser + version: [e.g. chrome 83, safari 14, firefox 105]
### Actual behaviour
- Migration does not convert the json values to the array structure of postgres. I think there is a rake task missing which will look up all values in the database and convert the json structures to array.
I attached a PoC how it could look like:

var properties = new MessageProperties();
properties.Headers[""a""] = ""value1"";
properties.Headers[""b""] = ""value2"";

This sample allocates memory under the hood as well :)
ImmutableDictionary allocates only logarithmic memory in such a case, which is obviously worse than Dictionary, but not that bad.
Let's move this discussion about Headers type to a separate PR, which will probably not be implemented in v8, because `IBasicProperties.Headers`(there are two implementations, class and readonly struct based) has `IDictionary<string, object?>` type in master branch."

@Gandalf1783 Given your lack of response, I'm assuming you just wanted to gaslight someone (me in this case) without any actual knowledge of the problem? You just wanted to sound like you knew more than someone else without knowing anything at all?
No program has enough knowledge (currently) to pull off what you think is trivial.
The terminal doesn't know the purpose of the text it displays, it can't do it.
zsh/omz/p10k doesn't know what happens in-between the prompts. They can control what is displayed on the current prompt lines. They can query where on the terminal they are, but once another program has run with unknown amount of text output and the screen scrolls, all for that previous knowledge is useless. Terminal queries for row number only apply to the displayed screen, not relative to the top of the scroll back buffer. To be fair, I too was annoyed by this some time ago and solved it for myself by displaying green/red lines across the entire terminal width before the next prompt is displayed. The color line is the status for everything above the line. I've left the prompt symbol in, but rarely look it. Here's an example:
<img width=""363"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15944841/224548171-55aae1cb-8d04-4feb-af7a-20a90993c3ad.png"">

Even that isn't trivial. Count linefeeds? What about lines that wrap to the next line? Output from a PAGER, such as as less? Output from htop? How do you count those lines?

It would have to duplicate everything the terminal is already doing to accurately determine how much screen space has been used. Not impossible, but hardly trivial.

#### Problem Description
I'm trying to use mitmproxy as part of an integration test in a project that depends on `cryptography`, specifically version `40.0.0`. I see that mitmproxy requires cryptography at `<38.1`. I can automate the creation of a separate venv for the mitmproxy stuff, but that's kind of clunky. I'd rather just make it a dependency and let poetry handle it. For that to happen, `mitmproxy` needs to be compatible with higher versions of cryptography.
I recognize that the `<38.1` constraint might be there for a good reason, but not knowing that reason I figured I'd file an issue and cross my fingers. Thanks for at least considering it.
#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Have a `pyproject.toml` like this:
```
...
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ""^3.10""
cryptography = ""^40.0.0""
[build-system]
requires = [""poetry-core""]
build-backend = ""poetry.core.masonry.api""
```
2. Run `poetry add mitmproxy`
3. See error:
```
Because no versions of mitmproxy match >9.0.1,<10.0.0
and mitmproxy (9.0.1) depends on cryptography (>=38.0,<38.1), mitmproxy (>=9.0.1,<10.0.0) requires cryptography (>=38.0,<38.1).
So, because foo depends on both cryptography (^40.0.0) and mitmproxy (^9.0.1), version solving failed.
```

OK, there were no error messages, but was it working? I believe it either didn't, or worked by accident. If you were using persistence 3 at the time, then you were not using short aliases.

### BC Break Report
<!-- Fill in the relevant information below to help triage your issue. -->
| Q | A
|------------ | ------
| BC Break | yes
| Version | 2.14.2
#### Summary
YES I UNDERSTAND that the relied upon feature (short namespace alias) is deprecated BUT upgrading in a MINOR release from 2.14.1 to 2.14.2 should not break an app that was working fine in 2.14.1 - that goes against SEMVER
#### Previous behavior
No error messages when using doctrine/orm 2.14.1 #### Current behavior
after composer update to doctrine/orm 2.14.2 from 2.14.1 - a minor release, now getting app crashes due to relying on deprecated features (I know I know) This is caused by now throwing Exceptions where no exceptions were previously thrown (because of a bug) https://github.com/doctrine/orm/pull/10489
<img width=""1280"" alt=""ScreenShot-2023-04-13-03 44 02"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/400092/231634531-65ba81f5-41f7-41af-b810-c8e54e973df5.png"">
#### How to reproduce
The related package is https://github.com/j-guyon/CommandSchedulerBundle which is a 3 year old release. Yes I know I know I know... but still, a minor release of doctrine/orm should not have breaking changes"
5931,1687989535,1527255788,Irony,I'm guessing this is by-design. If you specify an offset you should know what you're doing. @derickr Can you confirm/deny?
5932,1687989535,1527312982,None,"I'm guessing not, but am open to that. Actually, completely other thing that I was doing lead me to this ambiguity. So for example, this function works like charm:
```php
<?php
function getIsDaylightSaving($zoneid = 'America/Los_Angeles') {
try {
$date = new DateTime('now', new DateTimeZone($zoneid));
return $date->format('I');
} catch (Exception $e) {
return 400;
}
}
```
So if one try to do following:
```php
<?php
//get daylight saving time status from timezone identifier, $dst = getIsDaylightSaving('America/New_York');
//OUTPUT = 1 //which is OK
//but if I use foo timezone identifier like (this one differs built in IANA timezone db):
$dst = getIsDaylightSaving('ABBA/Mama_Mia');
//The instance new DateTime('now', new DateTimeZone($zoneid)); will throw an exception which will be caught in this function
//so the OUTPUT will be 400 //which is also OK.
```
So my point is that I was surprised that PHP didn't care about timezone offsets, but do care about timezone identifiers, since timezone offsets are only the following: ```php
<?php
$offsets = array('+00:00', '+01:00', '+02:00', '+03:00', '+03:30', '+04:00', '+04:30', '+05:00', '+05:30', '+05:45', '+06:00', '+06:30', '+07:00', '+08:00', '+08:45', '+09:00', '+09:30', '+10:00', '+10:30', '+11:00', '+12:00', '+12:45', '+13:00', '+14:00', '-01:00', '-02:00', '-02:30', '-03:00', '-04:00', '-05:00', '-06:00', '-07:00', '-08:00', '-09:00', '-09:30', '-10:00', '-11:00', '-12:00');
```
For that reason, I think it is a bug, or even some unfinished job. Anyway. I 'dodged a bullet' simply by checking for the offset myself. Everything else is explained in my first comment (i.e., _$time_ variables are expected user input variables).
Hope it helps."
5933,1687989535,1527674756,Impatience,"The offset isn't some magic string that identifies a location like the named timezones. It's an offset. An amount of hours and minutes ahead or behind UTC.
So what's the added value that comes with restricting the offset to only those that are in active, official use by some area of the world? What problems does doing so solve, or what advantages does it offer?

What is this comment? Some kind of words game? Joke? That I am not into? Apropos what is human-friendly, or not, all those values can be a device snapshot. Some distant device snapshot having an application installed on it, that is programmed by a distant developer on certain distant operating system, with some distant programming language, that a developer will use, through his application, to fetch certain data... Now, that developer can be a professional, but can also be not-professional. And now going deeper in that story that here is being presented to my report is pure game of words as this answer is. Yada yada yada ... Please don't waste my time or yours on unconstructive comments.
That is not a topic here. Anyone's programming tasks, styles or stuff like that is not a topic here. My point is that a PHP allows -01:10 value where it shouldn't. The end. Schluss. Ende. And that is all. And I didn't expect it to do so, to my surprise, though I use PHP on a daily basis since it's version 3."
5935,1687989535,1527782296,Bitter frustration,"That was a lot of words to say ""it's wrong because I think it's wrong"".
Why is it wrong to allow an offset that isn't in use by some (named) timezone? Why must it only allow offsets that can be found applied in (named) timezones?"
5936,1687989535,1528125573,Bitter frustration,"Well, because of your 'human readability' - 'user-friendliness' etc. Why would I as a developer risk using PHP DateTime object (DateTimeImmutable), without being sure it'll do all the jobs, because I do not want some Carbon datetime library to mess with my RFC 3339 datetime standards implementation, with my ISO 8601 datetime standards implementation and with WHATWG HTML living standard datetime standard implementation. That's why. But I am flexible. On constructive part of it. And I will always find a solution. This I consider a bug.

But before you do, realize that ""next"" is a rather common term used with random number sequences - as it is, in fact, basically a matter of _sequences_ and not simply conjuring some number out of a hat. That means PHP would actually be joining a club whose members use the word ""next"" when describing their randomness APIs:
* [Python 3's `random.random()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) is documented as ""return[ing] the next random floating point number in the range 0.0 <= X < 1.0"".
* [Java's `java.util.Random` class](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Random.html) has similar methods like ""next"", ""nextBoolean"", ""nextBytes"", and so on.
* Unsurprisingly, [Microsoft Java's own `System.Random` class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random?view=net-7.0) has a variety of methods named ""Next"", ""NextBytes"", ""NextDouble"", ""NextInt64"", and so on.
* [Rust's `rand::RngCore` trait](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/trait.RngCore.html), which is its lowest-level ""interface"" for randomness, names its two core methods ""next_u32"" and ""next_u64"".
So with any luck, allow me to offer my congratulations on you learning why the name ""nextFloat"" is not misleading after all.
(edited for humor)"

What kind of argument is that? As long as the stable is not issued, these things can be fixed, right?

They have all methods named *next*. That's perfectly fine. The problem is that in PHP we have `getFloat()` and `nextFloat()` at the same time, and the only difference is that the latter has a hardcoded interval. That's nonsense. Is it really not obvious to you?"
5957,1943190932,1763229255,Mocking,"> Is it really not obvious to you?
What's obvious to me is that the Randomizer API was introduced a year ago, nobody has complained about it since then, 8.3 just had its fourth RC with about 6 weeks left until the final release, and your primary argument for renaming the method is ""[I] find the name completely misleading"".
If ""I find it misleading"" was not easily countered by ""read the documentation"" then I'd pile on:
* It's misleading that `array_rand` returns a random key and not a random value
* It's misleading how `crypt` works, with its different modes and different salting requirements
* It's misleading what `parse_str` is supposed to parse
* It's misleading that the two different syntaxes of `strtok` are meant to work together in the same block of code
* It's misleading that the majority of PHP's string functions only support ASCII and not UTF-8/Unicode
* It's misleading that `echo` and `print` do the same thing yet have different calling syntaxes and requirements
* It's misleading that we have `_sleep`/`__wakeup` _and_ `__serialize`/`__unserialize` _and_ `__set_state` _and_ `Serializable`
* It's misleading that `stdClass` isn't a base class for all objects, which is something nearly all OOP languages have
* It's misleading that PHP doesn't have inherited variable scopes
* It's misleading that backed enums use strings/ints for their backed values and yet they aren't comparable (12410 at least)
* It's misleading that a Stringable object isn't compatible with a `string` hint in strict_types mode (12097)
* It's misleading that a `foreach($array as &$ref)` persists the reference after the loop (12335, 11885, 10369, and many others)
* It's misleading that a class with a `__toString` doesn't have its definition hoisted as of PHP 8.0 (12320, 8323, and others)
* It's misleading that PHP overflows/underflows dates when parsing (12121, 10479, and many others)
* It's misleading that `trim`/`rtrim`/`ltrim` trim characters and not substrings (11977, 11434, 9969, and others)
* Floating-point math (12198, 11070, 10661, and many others)
(if it's not obvious, towards the end there I started looking through the NAB list to find common problems)
Understand that I'm _not_ saying none of those issues above should ever be changed. I'm also not saying that those things are not worthy of complaining about because ""iT's DoCuMeNtEd BeHaViOr"".
What I am saying is that PHP just isn't a language where you can blindly start writing code and calling functions and expect everything to pan out as you might think. And that's also true, to varying degrees, for every programming language out there. So saying that something is misleading just isn't the hefty argument it sounds like: because there's a bunch of things that are going to be misleading to some people and not misleading to others; there's always going to be something you or I won't understand at first glance, and for the simple reason that neither of us are the sole voice of PHP's design decisions.
I doubt either of us wants to continue this conversation much further now, but I specifically mentioned going to the mailing list because _that's a totally valid reaction_ to me declining this report. Because you know what else is misleading? The fact that the PHP project does most of its discussions and decision-making on the mailing list and not in these GitHub Issues, and thus that we tend to treat feature requests here more like informal asks (ones that get closed after a few weeks of inactivity, no less) than full-blooded requests."

I would like to suggest changing the name or removing the `nextFloat()` method. Now is ideal time before the stable release, then it would be too late of course.
The name `nextFloat()` creates the expectation that it will return some other number in the generated series. See, for example, the following code:
```php
$randomizer = new \Random\Randomizer();
$a = $randomizer->getFloat(100, 200); // number between 100..200
$b = $randomizer->nextFloat(); // another number between 100..200 ???
```
Do you expect `$b` to be the next number in the interval 100..200? Surprisingly not, the method returns a number in the interval 0..1. Honestly, I don't understand the `next` prefix in the method name at all. Its [definition is](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/randomizer_additions#nextfloat):
> This method is equivalent to ->getFloat(0, 1)
That is, a function that returns a number in the interval 0..1 without any relation to anything previous. I therefore find the name completely misleading. A more accurate name would be, for example, `getFloat0To1()`, but I think that `getFloat(0, 1)` is obvious and there is no need to add a new method."

I get it, Composer isn’t a political platform. But, it's disheartening to see the selective empathy especially when the tech community has the power to raise awareness on serious issues.
Since opening this PR, more children have died in Gaza than all civilian casualties in Ukraine over the past month. In fact, the number of people who have died in Gaza in the past 17 days equals [the civilian casualties in the Ukraine war over the past year and a half](https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2023/09/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-11-september-2023). This really puts things into perspective."
