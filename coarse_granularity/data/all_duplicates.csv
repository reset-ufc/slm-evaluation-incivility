3988,"### Key information
""joda-time"" uses Kiev (incorrect) instead of Kyiv (correct) spelling.
Kyiv is a capital of Ukraine.
According to the Ukrainian local and international law, correct name of the ""Kiev"" is ""Kyiv"".
Reference materials:
- Local: Resolution No 55 of 27.01.2010 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine ""On regulation of transliteration of Ukrainian alphabet by means of Latin alphabet "".
- Global: https://unstats.un.org/UNSD/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/10th-uncsgn-docs/econf/E_CONF.101_85_Standardization%20of%20Geographical%20Names%20_eng.pdf
- Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KyivNotKiev
### Problem description
Incorrect spelling of Kyiv is used all across this project:
```

```
This issue should be fixed.
Instead of ""Kiev"" spelling ""Kyiv"" should be used instead.",0,msr,none

Project is out of compliance with Binary Artifacts policy: binaries present in source code
**Rule Description**
Binary Artifacts are an increased security risk in your repository. Binary artifacts cannot be reviewed, allowing the introduction of possibly obsolete or maliciously subverted executables. For more information see the [Security Scorecards Documentation](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#binary-artifacts) for Binary Artifacts.
**Remediation Steps**
To remediate, remove the generated executable artifacts from the repository.
**Artifacts Found**

- demos/plane/soy/SoyMsgExtractor.jar
- demos/plane/soy/SoyToJsSrcCompiler.jar

This policy is drawn from [Security Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/), which is a tool that scores a project's adherence to security best practices. You may wish to run a Scorecards scan directly on this repository for more details.",0,msr,none

The fact that you only saw this error on incremental builds but not clean ones, and that Bazel shows the ""failed to delete output files..."" error when it fails to delete outputs from the previous build, could be explained by a background process still holding the file open. This could be a persistent worker (perhaps JavaBuilder) that holds on to the output file, either because it doesn't close the file at all, or it doesn't close it in a timely manner.
