Sorry about that, here are hopefully all the relevant infos:\nMy server is a virtualization Server running Xen 4.4 with currently 6 virtual machines which all have their logical volumes (LVM) stored on a RAIDZ1 volume with 3x 2TB Seagate SATA enterprise disks (ST32000645NS). The Debian 8 OS is independent and located on two internal SATA-SSD disks of both 16 GB in RAID1 using Linux MD for mirroring. The CPU is an Intel E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40GHz with 6 cores/12 threads. Out of these 6 cores 4 vCPUs have been pinned to the host/hypervisor/dom0 using the `dom0_max_vcpus=4 dom0_vcpus_pin` Linux kernel options. The server has 64 GB of TruDDR4 ECC memory and out of this 64 GB of memory 6 GB has been reserved to the host/hypervisor/dom0 using the respective Linux kernel options `dom0_mem=6G,max:6G`. Finally I have reserved 2 GB RAM of these 6 GB for the ARC using the following `zfs_arc_max=2147483648` zfs module option.

In addition, pretending that the tutorial of\nscikit-learn is perfect in spite all the questions regarding loading the\nreal data (not the toy data as it is too easy to be imported comparing to\nthe real data) is something needs to be reconsidered, and this means that\nscikit-learn staff don't care about the name of scikit-learn at all.\nSecond, we can understand from your unsuitable way of talking that you\nalready forgot that scikit-learn is a product, and we as users are\ncustomers, so either you or the staff of scikit-learn should respect all of\nus and thank us for any comment or bug fixing. This is the professional way\nof behavior. So I recommend you to think of your words before saying them. If\nyou are knowing the way of loading the real data and you'd like to help,\ndon't only say go see pandas, better you answer people's question nicely\nrather than hurting them with your words, but if you're simply not able to\ndo that, so keep quite.\nOn the other hand, regarding the question \"should we instead add as a\nsection in the tutorial here?\", I would like to say \"_YES_\", you or\nscikit-learn staff should add a section in the official tutorial about how\nto load your own data either CSV, or ARFF or text or whatever, as users are\ninterested to load their own data, this is very critical issue should be\nconsidered in the tutorial (not to be ignored). *If you rely on the user,\nthen what is your work? *\nNevertheless, for those who are still struggling with scikit-learn, I would\nlike to say, this is not the end of the world, and as I mentioned\npreviously, find another to tool make your life much easier. For this\nreason, and in order to save your time, I would like to recommend some\ntools to assist you in data mining procedures. For instance, Waikato\nEnvironment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA),\nhttp://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/, last version is WEKA 3-7-13, is a\ncollection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. WEKA\nallows you to use its schemes either from GUI or writing Java code, so its\nvery easy for non-programmers. Additional to WEKA, R is also an excellent\ntool for data mining stuff, you can also perform tasks of R from WEKA or\nvice versa. However, if you have a patience to design a prediction process\nmanually (drag/drop), RapidMiner is a great tool for this propose where you\ncan design a very nice flow to achieve your target.\nThanks David van Leeuwen for your support.\nGood luck in your analysis.\nCheers,\nMartin\n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/3808#issuecomment-160153930\n> .",

Gael has in fact contributed a lot of user guides himself to scikit learn to help users.\nThe reason why he was opposing that addition to the tutorial was that there are multitude of ways in which users have their data stored and such a user guide on how to get the input data from all of them (a text file/csv file/database/zipped archive), is indeed out of scope for scikit learn, which is a machine learning library.\nThe most important thing to note here is that **it is very clearly explained by documentations of libraries which handle data, like numpy or pandas.**\nIt is expected from the user that he or she knows this! Since it seems to not be very clear, he suggests that we add a FAQ, pointing the user to such userguides, which are more elaborate than we could possibly get :)\nIt may appear that our tutorial could be a bit more elaborate on how the inputs are obtained. But the thing, in general, with userguides is that, it could _always_ be a little bit more elaborate, which makes us set a hard limit on how detailed our userguides can get, to help contain the userguide in a maintainable format :) If you think from that perspective, you yourself would understand our situation.\nAs this issue is open someone will indeed send a PR soon adding a nice FAQ entry and an example, maybe, which could help clarify your (or any other new user's) doubts on input formats.\nCheers!",

        "message": "Hello @MartinLion ,\nwe understand your eagerness to solve your problem, and your frustration when it is not solved.\nHowever, you seem quite misinformed about what is scikit-learn, how it works, and how the project is developed. Therefore, I would like to make some points clear for you. As you can see from\nhttp://scikit-learn.org/stable/about.html, scikit-learn is a community effort that is developed by a team of volunteers, mostly on their free time. Ga\u00ebl is one of the creators of the project and its current leader:\nscikit-learn would certainly not be the same without his contribution (the same for other volunteers), and he certainly did not deserve your dismissive words.\nWhat I would like to emphasize is that there is no such thing as a scikit-learn \"product\", or scikit-learn \"staff\" (only a handful of people have worked full time on the project). You mention \"we as users are\ncustomers\", but how much are you paying for using scikit-learn? Despite the important development cost, users get scikit-learn for free (and of course that's how it's intended to be). In fact, the development of the project relies on a fragile alchemy: users' needs being a top priority for developers, and users reporting bugs and concerns in the most positive way. The kind of \"ranting\" that you wrote can be very discouraging for developers, who contribute their free time and their expertise just because they believe that scikit-learn is a useful tool for the community. Some prominent developers stopped contributing to open-source software precisely because of such \"customer-like attitude\" of a few people underlining only shortcomings, and dismissing the huge development efforts. Please try to see the bright side as well: you received advice and comments from a lot of people, I'm sure that there was something for you to learn out of it, even if it did not solve your problem. Also, although users' needs are indeed a top priority of scikit-learn (it has an amazing documentation, of which most scientific Python packages can be jealous!), each software addresses a well-targeted niche of users, and it is just normal that scikit-learn cannot fit all users. For example, it is preferable to use scikit-learn with already a good knowledge of Scientific Python. So, I'm really glad that you found a\npackage that suited your needs better, but please also acknowledge the time and good will that people gave away when answering you.\nSo, folks, let's all show some good will and keep a constructive dialog.\nThat's how the project we love will keep on rocking!",

        "message": "Perhaps I should elaborate on my original frustration, to give you some context. I've been programming in Python almost exclusively for a year now (I am a late convert), and am fairly familiar with the ecosystem---I've done lot's of webservice related things, but also manipulation of resources related to automatic speech recognition. I do my scientific work in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) since a couple of years, and before that, in R, octave, c++/c (some 30 years in total). The Julia ecosystem is quite dynamic, and it is all very exciting, but Python just has this very large ecosystem and very clean coding, which makes it very attractive to use for little side experiments. This time I had to do some topic classification of (single sentence) text documents. Now there is an abundant choice of language technology tools in Python, and I believe that via [lda](https://pythonhosted.org/lda/index.html) I got to scikit-learn. Great tutorials, lovely datasets and all, but I found it very difficult to find out how to organize my own data so that I could load this in. Just now, I browsed through the user guide again to find the docs for \"load_files\", but I could't find an entry. So a google search for \"sklearn.datasets.load_files\" got me there just now, and I happened to remember the particular module path from more painstaking searches yesterday (it is mentioned somewhere in a tutorial). For me, the essential information would have been: \"Organize your data one document per file, one directory per class\"---more or less what's under the documentation for [load_files](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_files.html). This all makes perfect sense, but I come from a community where usual formats are \"one datapoint per line\", often with the class label on that line. But having said all this, I am pretty impressed how the Python (text) community has standardized data representation, from what I've seen so far. But perhaps because of the widely used standard data representation, this aspect has naturally less attention in documentation. As a final note, whenever I try to teach students how to use some scientific tool set or another, I have to spend quite some time on \"how to import your data\". Nobody likes to do it, it can be a lot of effort for what you potentially use only once, and is therefore always a difficult threshold.",

        "message": "@davidavdav I agree that loading data is a difficult and important thing. However, it is a domain-specific problem. You have a particular type of data. I have another. My data is medical images of brain activity. I can tell you how I organize my data and load them. I can even tell you that we have written a whole package about this, with its own documentation. But that will probably not help you.\nWhat you want is something that tells you how to organize and load _your_ data. Now, it may be that your data is something fairly classic, that many people have; for instance tabular data most often stored in CSV files. In which case there is a need for a package doing this data loading. I don't believe that it should be in scikit-learn. It needs to be in a package that is specialized for this data. For instance, we are not going to put image processing in scikit-learn. For tabular data, the dedicated package is pandas; as I mentioned in my reply we need to point to it. We, the scikit-learn team, want to make plugin pandas into scikit-learn easier. But it is not as easy as it may seem and it takes time (one of our core devs is prototyping something).\nI realize rereading your post that your data is most likely text documents. So my two examples of data (medical images and tabular data) were both wrong :$. Maybe the documentation on processing text with scikit-learn could indeed be improved and touch a bit on data organization. I don't know, I very seldom process text. But if you want to do add a few words on this, you are most welcomed to do a pull request. Anyhow, this illustrate my point about the diversity of the data: this whole thread is mostly about loading CSV files, as can be seen from earlier comments (before the thread exploded into a rant). The important thing is not the \"CSV\", which is the container, but the data model that underlies a CSV file. This data model is that of columns of data with different nature. It's a very different data model than processing text documents.\nAnd finally, you are unhappy that teaching people \"how to import your data\" is time consuming. I don't think that there is an easy fix for this, even in a specific domain. The reason being that data meaning (ie data semantics) is still very much an open area. It's intrinsically hard to describe what the data means and how it's organized. You can try a simple experience: grab a dataset from someone you don't know, about an experiment you don't know, and try understanding it. Not even loading it, just understanding it. I am sure that it will take time. What takes a human time tends to be very difficult for a computer.",

In your `Vagrantfile`, add the following lines `vm.box` and `vm.box_url` keys):\n```\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config|\nconfig.vm.box = \"laravel/homestead\"\nconfig.vm.box_url = \"file://c:/users/madmatt/path/to/the/json-file-you-created-in-step-2.json\"\nend\n```\n4. Run `vagrant up` as normal.\n5. `vagrant` will complain that the sha hash doesn't match (`The checksum of the downloaded box did not match...`). Take the string that appears next to 'Expected', copy and paste that into the `checksum` key of the json file you created in step 2.\n6. Run `vagrant up` again, this time it should load from the local file, store it as the correct name and version, and successfully run it.\nHopefully someone finds these steps useful... funnily enough I have done all this research (having never used vagrant before), have tested it a bunch of times, and the original `vagrant box add laravel/homestead` command that I started running 3 hours ago is still only 8% complete, even though in that time I've downloaded the box file 8 times outside of vagrant.\nThe rest of this is just my experience, no need to read further ;)\n# My experience (aka. why is vagrant so slow to download boxes)\nWas getting 420b/sec (yes, that's bytes per second) on a gigabit connection downloading https://vagrantcloud.com/laravel/boxes/homestead/versions/4.0.0/providers/virtualbox.box.\nI downloaded the same file via browser, curl and wget with speeds varying between 12 and 27MB/sec. I then tried doing both at the same time - I was able to download via Chrome, Firefox, curl and wget before ```vagrant box add laravel/homestead``` had downloaded 1%.\nThe URL I got in the browser was ```https://vagrantcloud-files-production.s3.amazonaws.com/archivist/boxes/47dce273-9892-4691-a746-c4f351ae44a5?X-Amz-Algorithm=<snip>&X-Amz-Credential=<snip>&X-Amz-Date=<snip>&X-Amz-Expires=<snip>&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=<snip>&X-Amz-Signature=<snip>```\nI don't know what the problem here is, but I can think of a couple:\n* Whatever UA vagrant uses is bad, and AWS severely limits it\n* Whatever vagrant uses to download isn't following redirects, or somehow never ends up downloading from AWS infrastructure, instead using some other terribly overloaded server/proxy",

You have to go out of your way, even when searching for illegal content, to find these kinds of torrents.

The end caps alone (without a bar) are very useful to indicate a secondary uncertainty, typically a systematic uncertainty, in addition to a statistical uncertainty indicated by the error bar.\nThe default changes are a great chance for matplotlib to go forward.

What I really want to use this answer for, is to strongly emphasis that the defaults should not focus on making nice looking plots but unambiguous ones. Aesthetics is to a certain point always up to the beholder, and he is encouraged to change the design in a way he finds pleasing. However, wrong information should never be conveyed. That is why it was so important to change the default color map. This belongs to me in the same category.\nThe plot I showed was exactly such an example (and it is a real-life example). I tried different algorithms and suddenly my plot showed me that algorithm 1 is orders of magnitude better, as there was no more visible error in comparison to plot 2. You can now say, just change the design how you like it. But that just makes it even more dangerous for me, as I might forget about the terrible choice matplotlib does. I go to a different machine and might do the same error again and might lose a workday if I am not careful.\nThus, I just plead, focus that the plots represent the information.

        "message": "I would have preferred to comment on #1275, but the present issue has the benefit to be still open.\nMy 2 cents on the sensitive subject of nullable embedded properties:\n- when the Embeddable has at least one non-nullable `@Column`, and this field is null in the database, **there should be no ambiguity** and **`null` should be assigned to the embedded property**. Otherwise (currently!) you get an empty, invalid value object that has non-nullable properties set to `null`. IMHO, the current implementation is broken here.\n- when all `@Column` in the Embeddable are nullable, there should be a boolean setting in the `@Embedded` annotation that controls whether or not you want an empty value object or a `null` value when all fields are `null` in the database. **Your choice**.\nFinally, you only have a real problem when you have a fully nullable embeddable, **and** want to make the distinction between a `null` property and an empty object. People have suggested to add an extra column in the table, which would work, but would add a ton of complexity for what I think is an edge case. To clarify, **I think this edge case should not be supported by Doctrine**.\nThe previous two bullet points, however, **I would strongly suggest working on them ASAP**.

For a time I worked around this by sourcing the nvm script everywhere but that seems to be a somewhat unmaintainable solution. The requirements I have:\n- NVM should just work in non-interactive sessions\n- Every user should be able to select a installed version of node (or use ```$ nvm exec```)\n- Some users should be able to install newer versions of node\nThis is the solution I came up with: (shout out to @icecoldphp, for the initial version)\n0. I've done this on a debian 8 machine, as the root user\n1. Create a group called \"nvm\", ```# groupadd nvm```\n2. Add root to the nvm group ```# usermod -aG nvm root```\n3. Goto the ```/opt``` directory and create a directory called nvm - Make sure the groupd owner is nvm ```# chown :nvm ./nvm```\n- Set the permissions so that the group is allowed to write in there and all file will inherit the group ```# chmod g+ws ./nvm```\n4. Follow the [git install](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#git-install) steps using ```/opt/nvm``` as the directory - To make sure the group can also write aliases, cache downloads and install global packages make sure the directories exist and have the correct permissions:\n```\n# mkdir /opt/nvm/.cache\n# mkdir /opt/nvm/versions\n# mkdir /opt/nvm/alias # chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/.cache\n# chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/versions\n# chmod -R g+ws /opt/nvm/alias\n```\n5. Using the following snippet create ```/etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```:\n```#/etc/profile.d/nvm.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nexport NVM_DIR=\"/opt/nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && . \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"\n```\n6. Ensure that the script is executable ```# chmod +x /etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```\n7. If you want to use nvm in non-interactive sessions as well make sure to source the nvm file in ```/etc/bash.bashrc``` before the line saying ```# If not running interactively, don't do anything``` by adding ```. /etc/profile.d/nvm.sh```.\n8. For bash completion (which is inherently interactive ;) add ```[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"``` after the section about bash completion.\nEvery user can select a version of node (as the permissions for public are ```r-x```) and users in the nvm group can install and remove versions of node (permissions for the group are ```rwx```).\nMy questions are:\n- As a developer I know next to nothing about linux, could this be improved, is it bad style, etc? Any feedback is welcome.\n- Should this be documented in the NVM README.md?",

The `zIndex` of each marker depends on the *vertical coordinate of the marker*. Look at this screenshot from https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.Icon.Glyph:\n![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/09ba35cbec1a15aaf2a599be333a85d701f69ead/68747470733a2f2f6c6561666c65742e6769746875622e696f2f4c6561666c65742e49636f6e2e476c7970682f64656d6f2e706e67)\nDo you see how you can only see the tip of the bottom-most markers? That's because the `zIndex` of the markers in the bottom row is greater than in the second row, which have a `zIndex` greater than those in the third row, and so on. The `zIndex` is not arbitrary. It grows by 1 for every pixel down. It also gets recalculated on zooming and some view resets.\nThus, the zIndex**Offset** option is an **offset** which applies to the seemingly arbitrary `zIndex`. Thus, if I wanted the center marker to be on top of the rest, I'd set a `zIndexOffset` of at least the height of a marker, and it would look like:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1125786/27128107-a2a6bbb4-50fd-11e7-8244-12efd37cc3d3.png)\n> All of this doesn't allow me to set different markers on top of others since step 2 change ruins any logic I may use in my code.\n> Here's the example of what happens in the leaflet playground:\nIf the problem is that you can't set which marker goes on top, *show me an example of how that fails*, because that playground only logs a value, it does not show me markers failing to display on top of other markers.

This means that I'll need to recalculate all markers zIndexOffsets on the map to make it work as I need which is too much. Also in our setup we may have dozens of markers on the map. This way we'll reach enormous values for zIndex which also seems not good...\nThat's the point that in case I could have managed the actual zIndex of markers on the map it would solve everything since I could have just decided that all active objects may have zIndex above 500 and all others will have below that. Then I should have just change values of last active objects zIndexes below 500 and the newly activated one above etc. And zIndexes of markers within a specific segment also could have similar logic, i.e below 550 inactive, above 550 - active.

As a concept it does have benefits of reuse, but it also carries downsides of maintenance overhead, complicated abstraction layers, difficult testability, side effects and surprises in behavioural changes... These days stateless interface-based implementations have become quite popular (especially with raise of functional languages) where each class has a single responsibility (or as close to that as possible) and gets all the dependencies injected via a constructor. This allows to write much cleaner and maintainable code, easier to unit test (as opposed to inheritance based classes where you would more likely be writing integration tests) and easier to alter behavior by substituting dependencies.\nAnother benefit of using interface-based architecture that you could plug in IoC container (e.g. autofac).\nOver the years I have experience both sides, I was a big proponent of OOP but I have learnt the hard way that it makes it much harder to maintain such code, especially in large projects.\nAs I observed, a lot of bugs stem from implementations with overloaded concerns and lack of unit tests. As a result the code is quite confusing, inflexible and hard maintain.\nIn my opinion, one of the ways we could start reducing the tech debt and improving the codebase - start extracting separate concerns into individual classes and compose them as required. Gradually we would be able migrate most of the codebase. Static methods have their use too, but as any tool they have to be used appropriately.",

Mocks have a strong tendency to deviate from the documented pre- and post-conditions of the original interfaces\nI am not sure if completely I understand your point.\nIf each class has a single responsibility (SR), then DI should not add any ambiguity - for each use case you set dependencies to imitate boundary conditions, but you **only** exercise and validate functionality of the class under test.\nAny changes to dependencies should not have any profound effect because the class is built against a contract and not a particular implementation. Certainly a degree of coupling is possible, but it typically it will be lose coupling.\nAlso a SR class (usually) define a limited number of methods (accessible via an interface). As a result you test the public surface. Generally there is a limited need to test internal or private methods (due to their absence).\nAnother benefit of smaller classes with SR - you know exactly what each class depends on. For example right now `GitModule` spans across 3,400+ lines of code carrying hundreds of methods. And we inject this monstrosity to classes which may need to access only one method from the lot...\nIf a class has multiple responsibilities and/or initialises its own concrete dependencies then it is virtually impossible to perform unit testing - instead you will be writing integration tests. Any changes to dependencies with high degree of probability will necessitate changes to the class, because there is a tight coupling to concrete implementations.\nWrt: code coverage - whilst it is a very useful metric, it shouldn't be viewed as an absolute. 100% CC can be very misleading.\nPersonally when I write tests I usually strive for 100% coverage taking in consideration various edge cases. I use NCrunch, it helps me to visualise what cases I may have missed.",

Like yours my position comes from practical experience solving real engineering challenges.\nI'm part of a small team building RAD framework and reusable components where pretty much every component can be substituted by a consumer. We have a number of major and minor releases concurrently powering hundreds of apps in production, and we provide full runtime backwards compatibility.\nWe can assume very little about consumers, their habits and requirements. In turn we must provide a great deal of flexibility but ensure stability of the framework core and consumer applications (to a degree). This is specifically important in security-related areas.\nAll of this dictates how we architect and engineer the framework, how we deal with dependencies, how we deploy and how we test.\nUntil we re-engineered the codebase to consist of interface based stateless single responsibility classes we had a number of challenges meeting the requirements (including production incidents). We also couldn't reason about stability and predictability of provided behaviors.\nNow we have 1,800+ .NET unit tests, hundreds of JS tests and probably another few thousand of BDD tests. Some tests, especially security-related, test the order of execution - without that we can't reason about predictability, nor we can release new versions or provide backwards compatibility.\nSmaller interface-based single responsibility implementations allow us to achieve * isolation (all dependencies are injected), * testability (all dependencies are mocked), * stability (via predictability), * flexibility (consumers only concern themselves with replacing a specific implementation instead of worrying about inter-dependencies).

        "message": "@RussKie Your last post really resonates with me. One of the goals I had when I was pushing so hard to switch away from mocks (on a former project) was based on the type of application being shipped to customers. As you are well aware, anything considered public API surface area has special requirements related to versioning. These requirements constrain the development team substantially, but are a great asset from the customers perspective. However, in an application where the final product is the application (as opposed to a publicly-consumable API), these same requirements *burden* the development team. I didn't like the fact that when we wanted to make a change to our implementation, we kept running into pain points (leading to delays) resembling those faced by developers trying to make changes to public APIs.\nAnother application (this time a library) I've contributed to over time is StringTemplate. While it has a few known extension points built in, it was never designed to be arbitrarily reconfigurable for end users. Over time it's led to a frustrating experience for a small subset of users trying to do arguably normal things, just things we didn't think of from the start. For example, by failing to abstract the file system (location and reading) away from the template loader, it's not possible to use *some* features of StringTemplate when the templates are stored e.g. in a database, or stored using a compression mechanism we didn't think of from the start. Better adherence to SRP would likely improve the long term durability and flexibility of this library.\nIt sounds to me like GitExtensions is unlikely to suffer from most of the problems related to reusable components, and more likely to benefit from a testing approach that focuses on application behavior.\n> > When testing UI controls, we actually created the control and interacted with it as a user would (yes this can be fast and reliable).\n>\n> @sharwell Is there any publicly available project that uses this approach - I would love to see this in action.\nNot to the extent of the one I've been referring to. I've started to add tests for UI related bug reports to PerfView, but these are quite limited and not particularly elegant currently.\nWhen I built a system like this in the past, I started with the following:\n1. Identify all mutable static state in the application. We will need a way to reset these to known default values between each test, ensuring that the outcome of any given test cannot influence the behavior of another (with a corollary that a test failure uniquely and deterministically identifies the culprit, which can then be executed in isolation to reproduce the failure):\n* Mutable `static` fields\n* File read and written\n* Registry keys/values read/written\n2. Identify all asynchronous operations. We will need a way to ensure that a test is not considered complete while one of these is executing (or scheduled for later execution, in the case of timers or delays).\n3. Identify external dependencies for which the concrete implementation is likely problematic for high-speed deterministic testing. We will need a way to substitute the behavior of these items during testing. The method of substitution must guarantee that during the execution of any given test, all executing code is using the same implementation (either the original or the substituted one, but never a mix and never multiple substitutes).\n* One obvious case is invocations of *git.exe* for many types of tests\n* Loading resources from a network\nOnce you address the above, most tests are still written against module interface boundaries. However, when actually testing UI behaviors it's not particularly challenging to write those tests against the controls. Most of the problems typically associated with testing UI behavior are really just failures to address one of the above underlying concerns.",

I am hesitant to encourage too many hacks to resolution logic, which is already complicated and difficult to debug.\n@brettdh I think I can shed some light because you have most of the pieces. `pipenv lock` doesn't install anything, and it doesn't claim to. It only generates the lockfile given your host environment, python version, and a provided `Pipfile`. If you manipulate your environment in some other way or if you use pip directly/manipulate pip settings outside of pipenv / are not using `pipenv run` or using `pip freeze` inside a pipenv subshell, it is quite easy for a lockfile to be out of sync from `pip freeze`. The two aren't really related.\nTo be clear:\n1. `Pipfile.lock` is a strictly-pinned dependency resolution using the pip-tools resolver based on the user's `Pipfile`\n2. If you want to maintain strict pins of everything while upgrading only one package, I believe you can do this by strictly pinning everything in your `Pipfile` except for the one thing you want to upgrade (correct me if I'm wrong @vphilippon)\nAs for your lockfile and `pip freeze` disagreeing with one another, I'd have to know more information, but I believe we have an open issue regarding our lockfile resolver when using non-system versions of python to resolve.",

In short, the locking mechanism reads the `Pipfile` and performs a full dependency resolution to select a full set of package that will meet *every* constraints defined by the required packages *and their dependencies*.\n@techalchemy > [...] it\u2019s resolving with pip-tools that concerns me.\nI'm not sure how those `--upgrade-strategy` would affect `pip-tools`, because it works on some low-level internals of `pip`. I have the feeling this would not give the expected result, as these option take into account what's installed, and that's not what's being dealt with in that mechanism. But we have another approach to this in `pip-tools` that could be done here.\nThe \"original\" `pip-tools` behavior is that it only updates what's is needed in the lockfile (in its context, its the requirements.txt), but this was \"lost\" in the way the resolver was integrated in `pipenv`. Let me explain why.\nPointing back to my resume of how `pip-tools` works: https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv/issues/875#issuecomment-337717817\nRemember the \"select a candidate\" part? That's done by querying the `Repository` object.\nIn `pipenv`, we directly configure a `PyPIRepository` for the `Resolver`, but `pip-tools` does something else, it uses a `LocalRequirementsRepository` object, which keeps the existing pins from the previously existing `requirements.txt` (if found), and \"fallbacks\" on `PyPIRepository`.\nSo in `pip-tools`, the following happens when selecting a candidate:\n1. Query `LocalRequirementsRepository` for a candidate that match `foobar>=1.0,<2.0`.\n1. Check if an existing pin meets that requirements:\n- If yes, return that pin as the candidate.\n- If not, query the `proxied_repository` (`PyPIRepository`) for the candidate.\n1.

I'm NOT saying that `pyproject.toml` needs a standard location for this metadata, but PEP 518 uses this file to install a build tool and from there it's very reasonable to expect that the build tool will use declarative configuration from somewhere else in the file to determine how to build the project.\nAnyway, going back to pipenv vs poetry - there seems to be some idea floating around that applications don't need certain features that libraries get, like entry points, and this is just incorrect. It should be straightforward for an application to be a python package.\nThe only true difference between an application and a library in my experience with python and with other ecosystems is whether you're using a lockfile or not. Of course there's a third case where you really just want a `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` and no actual code and that seems to be all that pipenv has focused on so far (`pipenv install -e .` falls into this category as pipenv is still afraid to try and support the package metadata). Unfortunately, while the design of pipenv is cleaner with this approach, it's also way less useful for most applications because PEP 518 decided to punt on how to install projects into editable mode so in order to continue using pipenv we will be stuck on setuptools quite a while longer as you cannot use `pyproject.toml` to switch away from setuptools and still use `pipenv install -e .`.",

This is a transfer format that goes in an sdist or wheel and is generated from a setup.py/setup.cfg, it is not a replacement as such for the user-facing metadata. PEP 518's usage of `pyproject.toml` is about supporting alternatives to distutils/setuptools as a build system, no one is trying to replace the sdist/wheel formats right now. Those replacement build systems need a place to put their metadata and fortunately PEP 517 reserved the `tool.` namespace for these systems to do so. It's not an assumption - **both flit and poetry have adopted this namespace for \"library definition metadata\".**\n> Try only defining a build system with no additional information about your project (i.e. no pep-345 compliant metadata) and upload it to pypi and let me know how that goes.\nHow constructive.\n> Who is saying that applications don't require entry points?

I cannot even find the word \"entry\" on any page of the pipenv documentation at https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ so \"an entire construct\" sounds pretty far fetched? If you mean editable installs then we have reached the point I was making above - with pipenv deciding to couple itself to `pipenv install -e .` as the only way to hook into and develop an application as a package, for the foreseeable future pipenv's support here is coupled to setuptools. I think the entire controversy boils down to this point really and people (certainly me) are frustrated that we can now define libraries that don't use setuptools but can't develop on them with pipenv. To be perfectly clear this isn't strictly pipenv's fault (PEP 518 decided to punt on editable installs), but its refusal to acknowledge the issue has been frustrating in the discourse as poetry provides an alternative that does handle this issue in a way that's compliant with the `pyproject.toml` format.

The keyword I'm missing is \"include_playbook\" which would allow a \"when\" to apply to it. Why?\nI have a playbook that performs some maintenance, OS, Kernel, package, and firmware upgrades. For Major upgrades, we track progress in a ticketing system. So, during those runs, I'd like to conditionally import a playbook that updates the ticket information. In order for that to work, I need to pass the user's password to the ticketing system, so there's a `vars_prompt` in the ticket update playbook. If the user specifies which ticket they're working to the maintenance playbook, I'd like the ticket update playbook to be called after the maintenance is performed.\nIf there's another way for this to work, I'm open to alternate ideas, but I think conditionally playbook imports would be generically useful. I'm not understanding why tasks could be included dynamically, but a playbook wouldn't be.\n##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE\n<!---\nFor bugs, show exactly how to reproduce the problem, using a minimal test-case.\nFor new features, show how the feature would be used.\n-->\n<!--- Paste example playbooks or commands between quotes below -->\n```yaml\n# Maintenance Play Runs first, then conditionally import a second playbook\n- import_playbook: update-ticket.yaml\nwhen: ticket_id is defined\n```\n<!--- You can also paste gist.github.com links for larger files -->\n##### EXPECTED RESULTS\n<!--- What did you expect to happen when running the steps above? -->\nI expect `update-ticket.yaml` to only import if the `ticket_id` is defined.\n##### ACTUAL RESULTS\n<!--- What actually happened? If possible run with extra verbosity (-vvvv) -->\nno parse error, and playbook `update-ticket.yaml` is imported 100% of the time.",

The requirements.yml file within the playbooks folder is similar to your Galaxy-style requirements.yml, but rather than calling out dependent playbooks by Galaxy owner.name, I specify the full Git source (Galaxy supports this of course). The requirements.yml within the roles/ folder is just your traditional Galaxy-style requirements.\nI have this `prerequisites.yml` playbook, that looks like this:\n```yaml\n---\n- name: PLAY | Install other required playbooks\nhosts: localhost\nconnection: local\ntasks:\n- name: INCLUDE_VARS | include variables to discover other needed playbooks\ninclude_vars:\ndir: playbooks/\nfiles_matching: requirements.yml\ndepth: 1\n- name: GIT | Clone playbooks\ngit:\nrepo: \"{{ item.src }}\"\ndest: \"playbooks/{{ item.src.split('/')[-1] }}\"\nversion: \"{{ item.version }}\"\nloop: \"{{ required_playbooks }}\"\n- name: SHELL | Install included playbooks roles\nshell: ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements.yml -p roles/ --force\nargs:\nchdir: \"playbooks/{{ item.src.split('/')[-1] }}\"\nloop: \"{{ required_playbooks }}\"\nwhen: item.galaxy\nchanged_when: false\ntags: [ skip_ansible_lint ]\n```\nAnd, assuming that my \"big bang\" create.yml depends on a playbook and its roles from another playbook project, I import it like this:\n```yaml\n# ~~~~~~~~~~\n# Ensure that all of the host VMs in the inventory are up and running\n# either on-prem or in Azure as specified in the inventory\n#\n- name: Ensure inventory hosts are present\nimport_playbook: \"playbooks/ap_linux_instance/create.yml\"\ntags: [ base_server, hosts ]\n```\nAnd so, the work-flow to run my \"big bang\" (e.g. create.yml) is a 3-liner:\n```bash\nansible-playbook prerequisites.yml\nansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements -p roles/\nansible-playbook create.yml -i <path_to_inventory>\n```\nYou could, of course, wrap the above 3-liner in a `create.sh` shell script for convenience. This method has served me well for some fairly complex playbook projects that depend on other playbook projects. This forces us to keep roles and playbooks fairly self-contained and re-usable and factor variables out into their own inventory projects. When performed with discipline, it makes it really easy to migrate unaltered roles/playbooks to other environments, then just update inventory variables that are unique to that environment.\n**This doesn't solve the conditional import problem**, mind you, but does help me use the `import_playbook` statement for something that may not exist just yet. It kind of gets around a conditional in my very specific use-case. I make use of tagging on the `import_playbook` to leverage the command-line `--tags` and `--skip-tags` features if I need scalpel-like precision at run-time. But if you had to make an import decision based on some other conditional logic (e.g., OS family), well, we still need that as a language feature I think. For now, I just handle those cases with sub-playbooks and chain them together ensuring I target the appropriate hosts/groups that should or should not be targeted based on how I've setup my inventory (yes, it can get messy).\nThis is all pretty wild and requires a high degree if what I commonly refer to as \"4th dimensional thinking\", especially when you consider branches/versions of things and running them from CI/CD platforms like Jenkins or even AWX. But I still find Ansible fascinating and use it daily.\nHTH,\nBen",

        "message": "This patch accommodates some breaking changes introduced with MySQL 8.\nCloses #1959 In a nutshell, the `caching_sha2_password` plugin (which is used by default since MySQL 8.0.4) hashes the password using SHA-256 and, after a first successful authentication attempt, saves it in a cache. That first attempt needs to be done under one of two conditions. The client either uses SSL and sends the password as clear text or it encrypts the password using the RSA public key generated by the server. On any subsequent attempt, until the password is somehow removed from the cache or the server shuts down, these rules no longer apply.\nThe handshake process remains unchanged when connecting to any server with version lower or equal to `8.0.3`. Whereas for `8.0.4` or above, the process is now the following:\n- the client sends a `ClientAuthenticationPacket` with a scramble computed using a SHA-256 hash\n- if the password is not cached, the server sends back a `PerformFullAuthenticationPacket`\n- if the client uses SSL, the password is sent to the server (as clear text) via a `ClearTextPasswordPacket` to which the server replies with a `OkPacket`\n- otherwise it uses the server authentication public key compute the scramble, sending a `AuthSwitchResponsePacket` to which the server replies with a `OkPacket`\n- if the client does not know the server public key (is not provided by the user), it requests it from the server, which sends it back using a `AuthMoreDataPacket`\n- after a first successful authentication attempt, and until the password is cached, the server will reply to the initial `ClientAuthenticationPacket` with a `FastAuthSuccessPacket` (which basically just signals that an `OkPacket` will follow)\nIf the account is created using the `mysql_native_password` authentication plugin, the client will just fall back to the \"traditional\" process during the handshake, keeping compatibility, by default for any previously supported server version.\nMySQL 8.0.2 disables the `local_infile` server variable by default, which breaks a couple of integration tests. The tests were updated to enable the feature by themselves (something that does not have any effect on older server versions and allows the tests to pass with newer versions).\nAdditionally, one of the integration tests was updated to avoid failing after the first run (using any server version) since it tried to create a table that already existed from the previous runs.",

This is also clear in RFC 2865. Nothing was changed in later RFCs.\nYour proxy might work for one RADIUS client. It definitely won't work for multiple RADIUS clients. Or, it will, but they all have to use the same shared secret.\nRFC 2865 explains that you find the shared secret by looking up the source IP of the packet. This means that all downstream servers will look up *your* proxy IP to get *one* shared secret. If the originating UDP clients use *multiple* shared secrets, it won't work.\nAnd no, you can't change shared secrets per packet. And no, you can't change shared secrets per destination.\nIf you want to learn other UDP to TCP proxy issues, read RFC 6613. It explains all of these issues in excruciating detail.\nTBH, you can't just write a \"UDP to TCP\" translator for RADIUS and expect it to work. You MUST implement the RADIUS protocol correctly. This involves reading, and following, the RFCs.\nAny short-cut you take means that you have a toy implementation.

The text that is currently printed in a distinct color, is the text that was printed on the \"stderr\" output of subprocesses. Typically, this contains errors, but this is not necessarily so. For the compiler, it is also used for warnings. Avrdude even prints all of its verbose output to stderr. Prefixing each line with \"ERROR\" or something similar would probably only confuse users. More correct would be to prefix each line with \"stdout\" or \"stderr\", but that would still confuse novice users who have no clue what these terms mean.\nThe current approach of using a different color seems to bypass this problem by not explicitly stating what the colored text means, it just draws more attention to it.\nAs for using a different color to improve readability: That seems like a viable option to me. Of course, using a red or red-ish color for errors (and some other stuff, as pointed out above) seems common, which is probably why it is done now. Using e.g. green would also draw attention to the text, but I *think* users would not expect green text to contain error messages, so it might be better to consider other colors. @tofrnr also suggested a yellow color, which could work IMHO.\nAs for making things bold: I'm not sure if that would stand out sufficiently, but that might just need an experiment perhaps?",

As Anika says, cookies do not store the IP (or even DNS entry) of the user, the IP address is instead sent with every request.\nNot storing IP addresses is also not the solution as there is a very valid reason to store them at least temporarily: detect and remove vandalism (by IP address you can identify the connection between several edits, possibly even several user accounts) and to be able to identify the author (at least in court) if the content posted was illegal and the site owner gets sued because of that.\nWhat I think would be a good thing is to have some automatic way to remove IP addresses after some time, at least for changes where the user has been logged in (this could be a plugin of course). For anonymous edits I'm not sure if the IP address can be interpreted as an author identification that needs to be stored because of the license (but this of course depends on the selected license).\nConcerning the removal of the user name: my personal (non-lawyer) interpretation is that due to the license of the content (creative commons license at least with attribution), DokuWiki has a legitimate interest to store this attribution as it otherwise cannot use the content and as the Wikimedia issue tracker says \"the right of erasure only exists when the processing is not necessary for some legitimate interest of the data controller\".",

Base color and emissive textures in glTF (and, typically, diffuse textures in any format...) are in sRGB colorspace. GLTFLoader marks them as such (`material.map.encoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding`), so that they're converted to linear colorspace for correct PBR lighting calculations. Finally colors should be converted back to sRGB (e.g. `renderer.gammaOutput=true`).\nIf you skip all of this, with any format, lighting calculations are incorrect. SEA3DLoader, FBXLoader, and ColladaLoader never touch the `.encoding` property of any texture, and leave it to the end user to change texture colorspace and renderer colorspace. I'm pretty confident that the large majority of three.js users are passing sRGB colors into three.js without converting, despite the fact that renderer lighting calculations assume linear colorspace, and getting results that are \"good enough\" but inconsistent with other engines and authoring environments. For correct results you should be using `renderer.gammaOutput=true`, and marking sRGB textures as sRGB.\nNone of these issue are specific to glTF (see https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/11337), but with GLTFLoader we're trying to achieve consistency with other engines and 3D authoring environments, and have chosen to treat all sRGB textures as sRGB for a first step. If you're mixing models from other formats in the scene, then yes it's awkward, and you'd need to either mark the diffuse textures of those formats as sRGB or mark the colorspace on the glTF models to linear (the latter is incorrect for all model formats involved, but may look good enough if you don't need precise colors).\n***\nIt does not seem like there is anything actionable here, unless there are specific issues we can report to the tools mentioned. @RemusMar if you are happy with your SEA3D workflow, that's great \u2014 I'm not interested in debating formats or persuading you to change from something that is already working well for you.",

Yeah, it's unfortunate but I agree that it's not worth breaking backwards compatibility over this. However, as I've been working with larger FBX scenes consisting of multiple models, animated cameras and so on I've found myself wishing that the output of the loader was something more like GLTFLoader's output - that is, it should return an `fbx` object with properties:\n```\nfbx.animations; // Array<THREE.AnimationClip>\nfbx.models; // Array <THREE.Group, THREE.Mesh, THREE.SkinnedMesh>\nfbx.cameras; // Array<THREE.Camera>\nfbx.asset; // Object\n```\nThere may be other loaders that would benefit from a similar change. We should add this to the backburner (and certainly wait on #11337), but if any loaders do have breaking changes made for whatever reason, then we can use that as opportunity to apply this change as well.

        "message": ">That bad choice is yours, but the GLTFLoader is part of THREE, so it's up to Ricardo ( @mrdoob ) if they will be removed or not.\nErrr.... this is extremely fuzzy. `GLTFLoader` appears to be a community provided example, that lives in `/examples`. If you load three.js alone (`three.min.js`) there wont be any mention of GLTF.\nIf you use three.js off the shelf you get a scenegraph and various webgl abstractions. In this context, GLTF is just another one of many many examples of how you can translate some generic 3d data / scene file into three.js's structs. So, at a glance, three.js seems like this generic library, that draws stuff to screen. It doesn't care if you fetch that data from some remote server, and it doesn't care how you parse it (collada, fbx, sea3d, gltf... and 40 others). At the end of the day, you are rendering a `THREE.Mesh` with `THREE.Geometry` and `THREE.Material`. **Absolutely all of the loaders share this feature. All of them result in this data structure.**\nHowever, in practice, this is not the case, and you seem to be in the right. GLTF is a \"first class citizen\" of three.js. @mrdoob wrote that several times. SEA3d is some **random format** written by **some unknown people** while GLTF has the backing of THE khronos group. On top of that, it's probably meant to be the backbone of the whole VR/AR revolution, hence so much backing by other big players. This is just an unfortunate circumstance that three.js found itself in as the most widely used webgl library. People want to do 3d, which three.js solves really well with it's scene graph and other abstractions (things like `Mesh`, `Geometry`, `Material`, `Texture` etc.). Unfortunately, people also want to make experiences and expect three.js to be able to do that. This is of course complicated, hence, favoring one particular format and giving it preferential treatment makes sense. It may somewhat hurt the very essence of the library (draw stuff on screen) but it's a trade off. If you care to read all the guidelines, there's a document called [owners](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Owners). @donmccurdy owns that particular loader, so his word carries as much weight as @mrdoob's, so good luck there :)\nThe directive right now is:\n>three.js must support gltf\nSo anything that the khronos group comes up with has to be reflected in three.js. If you look at the discussion historically, @mrdoob doesn't really follow what's going on and @donmccurdy is the authority on all things khronos/gltf related.\nSo for example, khronos has defined a specification for gltf \"extensions\". Out of infinitely many extensions, one involves texture transformations. It has been ratified by the khronos group and because of that, **three.js absolutely must support it**. This warrants a PR with **11 thousands line of code** and increasing the size of the library by 1/3.

        "message": "[I have read the previous stance on the idea of allowing composer to manage multiple versions of a given package.](https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/2167) However, I would like to re-open the discussion as there are valid use cases for wanting multiple versions installed in parallel. I would counter that this is completely possible based on the following arguments:\n1. It's not composer's responsibility to ensure that a developer doesn't try to do something they aren't supposed to do; mind you, it would be fair of composer to issue a stern warning, but ultimately allow a developer to shoot themselves in the foot if that's what they so choose to do.\n1. PHP's namespace aliasing and/or composer's autoloader might be a way to work around loading two classes from different versions of a package -- in other words, manipulate the namespace in the autoloader so that if I install versions `2.0` and `3.0` of `package/xyz` (with a namespace of `Package\\Xyz`) I could reference them in code as either `Package\\Xyz\\2.0\\MyClass or `Package\\Xyz\\3.0\\MyClass`. And if I wanted to import both of them, I could alias the second one to a non-conflicting class name (see point 1 above).\n1. There are use-cases where packages are installed to be run as commands (e.g., phpunit, pdepend, phpcs, phpdoc, phpstan, et al) and would not be included/required directly into a PHP project's code base\nOne use case I've run into is that I want to install `ramsey/jenkins-php`, which inheritantly depends on `nikic/php-parser: ^1.0`, as well as `phpstan/phpstan-symfony` which inheritantly depends on `nikic/php-parser: ^4.0`. Both are commands to be run from a shell, so there would be no actual conflict with each other. The only thing stopping them from both being installed side by side is that composer does not support multiple versions of the same library.\nI understand that this is probably going to be a decisive feature request. I also understand I've probably not thought out every single possible hurdle to making this happen. But I feel like this is an important request to discuss with you and the composer community.\nThank you!",

After having thought about this issue for some years, I don't think there is any \"ideal solution\"\u2014this may be one of those problems where there are only suboptimal choices.\n---\nPeople naively view global scope as a funny kind enclosing local scope. This is why global scopes worked the way they did in Julia 0.6 and prior:\n- If an outer local scope creates a local variable and an inner local scope assigns to it, then that assignment updates the outer local variable.\n- If an outer global scope creates a global variable and an inner local scope assigns to it, then that assignment previously updated the outer global variable.\nThe main difference, however, is:\n- Whether an outer local variable exists, by design, does not depend on the order of appearance or execution of the expressions in the outer local scope.\n- Whether a global variable exists, however, cannot be independent of order, since one evaluates expressions in global scope, one at a time.\nMoreover, since global scopes are often quite lengthy\u2014not infrequently spread across multiple files\u2014having the meaning of an expression depend upon other expressions an arbitrary distance from it, is a \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d effect, and as such, quite undesirable.\n---\nThis last observation shows why having the two different versions of a for loop at global scope behave differently is problematic:\n```jl\n# file1.jl\nfor i = 1:5\na += 1\nend\n```\n```jl\n# file2.jl\na = 1\n```\n```jl\n# file3.jl\nfor i = 1:5\na += 1\nend\n```\n```jl\n# main.jl\ninclude(\"file1.jl\")\ninclude(\"file2.jl\")\ninclude(\"file3.jl\")\n```\nAlso note that the contents of `file1.jl` and `file3.jl` are identical and we could simplify the example by including the same file twice with a different meaning and behavior each time.",

        "message": "> We have actually never fully supported copying and pasting code from a function line-by-line into the REPL. So we can view this as an opportunity to make that work.\nI very much appreciate this sentiment and for my use cases it would really help. From my perspective it is really about making the REPL as useful as possible rather than changing the scoping rules of the language directly. That said, the more I think about this problem the more I see the conflicting views I (personally) hold as to what the REPL should do.\nTo be concrete, I'd very much like it if the REPL matched the scoping rules of a function body; i.e., variables are local rather than global and you can just copy-and-paste code directly from a function and know that it will work. I imagine a naive implementation would be something like let-block wrapping (as has been mention previously) of the form\n```\njulia> b = a + 1\n```\nbeing transformed into\n```julia\nlet a = _vars[:a]::Float64 # extract the variables used from the backing store\n# Code from the REPL\nb = a + 1\n# Save assigned variables back to the backing store\n_vars[:b] = b\nend\n```\nDone properly (i.e., by someone who knows what they are doing), I imagine that this would have a number of benefits over the existing REPL. 1. previous workflows with interactive data analysis/computation just work. 2. far fewer posts on Discourse where the basic response is \"stop benchmarking with global variables\" - everything would be local and so hopefully fast! :) 3. copy-and-paste to/from a function body works as expected. 4. a `workspace()` like function is trivial if the backing store is some sort of Dict; just clear it out. 5. globals become explicit - things are local unless you specifically ask for them to be global; this is a big advantage from my perspective, I don't like implicitly creating globals. A very minor final point (and I hestiate to add this!), this would match the behaviour of Matlab making it easier for people transitioning - at the Matlab REPL all variables seem to be local unless explicitly annotated as global. Until a few hours ago this story sounded great to me. But after Jeff's comment about functions I thought about pasting in stand-alone function definitions and how this approach would basically prevent that since function definitions should go in the global scope (at least, that is probably what is intended); but then what if they *were* intended to go into the local scope (an inner function)? There is no information to disambiguate the two possibilities. It would seem that two REPL modes are needed, one with local scope and one global scope. On one hand that could be very confusing (imagine the Discourse posts...) but on the other it could be extremely useful. (Having both REPL modes would also be non-breaking since you are just introducing new functionality :) )\nGoing for the halfway house of `SoftGlobalScope.jl` might end up being the least confusing compromise but my worry is that it's just another set of rules to remember (which things work in the REPL but not in my function body/global scope and vice-versa).\nApologies for the long post but I think this is important for usability (and it helped me think it through!).",

I must have missed that. Nevertheless, this does not mean that this behavior is not a source of bugs or unexpected results; just that after the user has figured it out, it was recognized as correct behavior and thus did not prompt an issue/complaint.\n> In Julia 1.0, I'm honestly worried about what I will do if I'm in the middle of a linear-algebra lecture and have to mysteriously type a global keyword\nI sympathize with this problem. When I taught into some simple programming to econ students necessary for a course, I usually suggested that they go back and forth between wrapping code in functions, and simply commenting out `function` and `end` and running things in the global scope, so they could inspect what is happening. This pretty much made up for the lack of debugging infrastructure at that time in Julia.\nIt appears this approach is no longer feasible. But I wonder if it was really the right way to do it anyway, and in the meantime various things have improved a lot (#265 was fixed, [Revise.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl) and recently [Rebugger.j](https://github.com/timholy/Rebugger.jl) have improved workflow/debugging considerably).\nIt seems that this issue does not bother experienced users very much, the main concern is confusion in a pedagogical setting.

Unfortunately userobj_accounting is enabled, which means that FreeBSD won't take the pool due to an unsupported feature.\nI saw mention of [this commit](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs/commit/83025286175d1ee1c29b842531070f3250a172ba) enabling feature disable functionality. I grabbed a Ubuntu 14.04 boot disk and installed ZoL (and an SPL from about that time) from that pull request, but am still getting reference to userobj_accounting being an \"unsupported feature\" when I try to import the pool.\nI'm not sure if the pool should be mounted or not?\nWith the pool exported, trying zhack returns:\n```\nroot@ubuntu:~/zfs# zhack feature disable media org.zfsonlinux:userobj_accounting\nzhack: feature 'org.zfsonlinux:userobj_accounting' is active, can not disable\n```",

Since this begs finally some proper attention, I will describe this issue (feel free to remove the comment later as you obviously are seemingly easily to have your feelings hurt regardless of whether the other person intended so or not...).\nI'll just clarify a few things: I've never asked for help in the channel and treated someone \"poorly\". I responded ironically to ptx0's messages, after he spent the past few hours being dismissive or condescending to other people, obviously in some cases users with a very limited skill around ZFS, but that does not merit acting like an imbecile. None of them were insults or hostile, they simply pointed out that ptx0 was assuming things constantly and then replying with an air of arrogance and usually in a condescending tone, despite himself being far from a beacon of excellence as far as technical skill or coding go. Immediately after he proceeded to ban me from the channel, to which I responded in -social pointing out that his attitude and actions making him look puerile and petty regardless of the nature of the \"offense\" by someone else. This knee-jerk reaction came motivated more by petty personal sentiments (and sharing those with some others who, well, fit that profile) than any actually reasonable reasons.\nNow, on the project: you are routinely accepting patches quite obviously without really doing your due diligence, ensuring proper QA, etc. Case in point, the one we have here. It's painful to see that you waste more time on petty nothings over actually making your code or merged patches look like something with a modicum of technical quality. The control over whether contributors are just copy-pasting from other spots (*hint* licensing violations get people sued), if the patches actually conflict with major kernel features, or symbol exports, or..... is lacking all over the place.\nHow about instead of making up half-truths about people offending your feelings, or your buddies' feelings, you go and properly benefit from the resources you so adamantly defend (and ask others to work with): How difficult was it to grab the patch I sent you from the link, test it, test it again, sign it off and merge it? You need to go around deleting comments and engaging in conversation with the other troll, but you are too busy to actually merge an out of band patch while you waste time over petty fights? Well, good luck with that. And you are surprised ZoL is not taken seriously anywhere but by the homelab/non-enterprise crowd. If you want to be a primadonna, at least have the cards in your sleeve to back it up: you can't justify it right now with the standard you are providing your users. And it runs in ring0, so go figure a better way to fend off all those users popping up on IRC asking about destroyed data because you merged a patch from a pull-request that would not stand a moment in the LKML.",

The points I was trying to articulate are that this request:\n- doesn't expose any data that would previously be inaccessible / enterprise.\n- doesn't suggest structuring the results in a way that is easier to parse/interpret programatically\n- only suggests what we believe is better practice by outputting using a logger which is the standard practice\n- would allow for common, modern log shippers to ship your output with our creating message noise, where each println is interpreted as a new log event.\nI literally don't see a single reason you would be against it this request. I've read through your comments multiple times and I still don't see a single argument you have given explaining why . > Sorry, but all new features regarding stats (additional stats, pushing stats elsewhere) fall into the scope of FrontLine, our Enterprise version.\nFair enough to that statement, but we're not talking about additional stats, pushing stats or anything about stats.

For arithmetic with more granular units of time like days, months or years, you probably want to stick with Period objects.\nSo, if using lubridate, my advice for @Demetrio92 and @robertwwalker is to switch to `dminutes()` and `dhours()` as that seems to be what you are expecting. That will match your intuition if you were expecting a result equal to \"sitting in a chair for 1160 minutes, then looking at the clock\" (assuming that your clock automatically adjusts itself for DST).\nYou could also try using [clock](https://clock.r-lib.org/).

When math is performed with a period object, each unit is applied separately. How the length of a period is distributed among its units is non-trivial.

They are measured in common time related units: years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Each unit except for seconds must be expressed in integer values.\nI do not see why this description contradicts my expected output. Specifically it says stuff like >or example, when leap seconds occur 1 minute is longer than 60 seconds. My impression here would be that periods are more robust than durations. -----\nI generally agree, the issue is more deep than just two functions that supposed to do the same. Still, worst case, rename `minutes` into `pminutes`. ----\nI am glad `period` now contains a warning. At least people who carefully study the docs will be aware. > Note: Arithmetic with periods can result in undefined behavior when non-existent dates are involved (such as February 29th in non-leap years). Please see Period for more details and %m+% and add_with_rollback() for alternative operations.\nComing from postgres I just did `+minutes()` and it worked as expected without any issues until it didn't.

We cannot get there with all these separate files in their current form with all sorts of global state all over the place. And as I keep maintaining, the majority of the code outside of retroarch.c and libretro-common should become 80 to 90% tasks, thread-safe and all. Anything global has to go into one centralized place, so that we can make order out of chaos. Not to mention it's more optimal this way as well.

Let's try again:\n```\nCannot set up a python SDK at Python 3.8 (dactyl-python) (C:\\Users\\xxx\\.conda\\envs\\dactyl-python\\python.exe).\nThe SDK seems invalid.\n```\nWut? Why would it even...!? *uninstall and reinstall anaconda3 a few times to try again*\n*uninstall anaconda3*\n*try miniconda instead*\n*manually set conda.exe env path, because that somehow didn't happen during install*\nconda activate cadquery\n``` CommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda activate'. ```\nk? That's probably not supposed to happen *uninstalls miniconda*\n*I realize environments are left behind in some directory, removes 6 GB of environments manually*\n*install miniconda again. Installation mentions that it's recommended to start anaconda from start menu to set environment variables* *anaconda/miniconda does not appear in start menu*\n*Google how to set miniconda in env path*\n*Can't find conda.exe anywhere, reinstall minconda3 to let installation add miniconda to path, against installation recommendation yet according to documentation recommendation (they contract each other)*\nFinally figured out what the problem was: I had Python 39 installed, but Conda can only handle up to Python 38 (which is unfortunate, because I would like to use dataclasses which are a Python 39 thing). Deleted all references to Python from environment variables (including Pythonhome/pythonpath), reinstalled minconda, chocolatey refreshenv, closed and reopened terminal and now the conda command works.

Disclaimer, this is my personal opinion and I'm probably a n00b, but: I hate anaconda. Messing around with toolchains is my main frustration with coding. This is not the first time random conda crap makes my cry. I've made it work in the past, I've worked with it in the past, but I just can't get it to work now for the above reasons. It's unfortunate that this is not explained in docs that I found and even more unfortunate that Miniconda install doesn't detect that Python is already on the path and might cause problems (and I can't use system python now? I'm confused?). And this is even before all the potential environment and dependency mess. ugggggggggggg. I'm not trying to flame cadquery devs here, I love cadquery itself, it's awesome.

We don't have a solution to this, but I'm pretty sure that everyone involved wants to solve this problem. Right now it's stuck in the \"discuss possible ideas\" phase, largely because nobody has stepped up to write, submit, and champion a PEP for a possible solution (not that that PEP would be guaranteed to be accepted, but that's how those projects make decisions).\nThe Venn diagram of people who have the \"large binary\" problem, people who care/want to work on pip/PyPI, and people who have the time to work on the above is pretty small, so it'll likely languish until someone gets more time, it bubbles up to be a much larger problem, or someone external champions an idea that gets successfully accepted.",

I know that there were some tries to do it but all links in this issue I've opened so far led to repositories almost 2 years old + attempts in **nixpkgs** repo seem to also have been abandoned. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\nBtw. my goals are following:\n- pywrap, ocp and cadquery must be easily buildable locally from source code. No hackary like repackaging conda packages! Also use normal OCCT package (of a properly tested fixed version) from *nixkgs* as a source of headers not the ones added/hardcoded into the repos as submodule.\n- Package **libclang**'s missing python bindings and provide them as an **nixpkgs** overlay in a flake until it's in **nixpkgs**.\n- Each project should have nix flake inside its repo. One could then directly install them using their github urls. CQ maintainers would have to be OK with it of course.\n- For each project also provide a development shell inside its flake so one can just fire up VSCode/ium inside it and work on the code.\n- Finally provide an exemplary devShell where CadQuery is installed so one can open open VSCode/ium or whatever editor inside it and start drawing immediately.\n- Also package CQ-editor and provide an exemplary devShell with both CadQuery and CQ-editor.\nSo far it's going good but I'm going to have to add a parameter into **pywrap** through which one can fully specify all clang's parameters. `--include` is not sufficient since Nix does not use UNIX-like filesystem hierarchy with global libraries and everything from sysroot to libcxx include paths (`-isystem` not `-I`) have to be specified. Not to mention a possibility of crosscompilation. Those flag are calculated automatically by nixpkgs's buiild infrastructure but have to be passed in when not using clang's wrapper shell script.",

Anyway I see several solutions : 1. Install miniconda, this avoid most of the burden of Anaconda while retaining the easy install of binary package anaconda provides ( You can also look at mamba and micromamba that can also be a good replacement)\n2. CQ-editor and jupyter-cadquery allow you to use an external editor, CQ-editor can refresh the view when you save a file (that can be outside the editor) jupyter-cadquery as a external viewer that run in your browser and gets updated when you call the show function in your script.\n3.

It feels more like people arguing over vim & emacs rather than trying to come to a good solution to empower a community. I'm curious about a couple practical matters brought up here.\nFirst, regarding the distribution of pre-compiled binaries. Who cares about making OCCT/OCP being available as a low-level dependency to other projects? That's not what the goal is here. Just package it up and make it part of cadquery, and if people want to use it like a library they can always depend on cadquery. I just checked, and the cadquery source itself is less than 600k, so this isn't a big deal at all. Many other python bindings to C (and C++) projects do exactly this, like tensorflow. As an alternative, the OCCT+OCP component could be packaged as a tarball, .deb, homebrew, etc., and then this would be installed separately before pip installing cadquery. In the same way that we need to download and install CUDA and CUDNN from nvidia before using tensorflow, this is a pattern that works just fine.\nSecond, the file size issue... is this really an issue? I just built opencascade 7.5 and the compiled libs + include headers are about 100 MB. I'm curious how this could become 1.5 GB with the addition of \"thin\" python wrappers, and whether all of the modules are even required. Maybe some of the challenge can be simplified by pruning the build output so that the end result is more manageable?\nLast, as a final option, the NLTK example given above which requires a download() call (which means the size is irrelevant because it can just download from a github release link) sounds quite practical. What are the drawbacks of this approach for users? Clearly by the many people who care about this issue Conda is a constant source of pain, and in some cases just isn't an option. That download call can just look in .local/lib/CadQuery to see if it's installed already, and if not download it. This is simple, easy to verify, and not error prone. CadQuery is primarily a user tool, not something that will be deployed, but even if it is that could be setup in a dockerfile and done once on build, which is how most deployments happen these days anyways.\nMy prediction is that once cadquery is easily installable via pip so people can read a blog post and try it out in a moment of curiosity the user base, interest, projects and tools built using cadquery will all increase.",

To no avail.\nOkay, so, to document it down.\n- mtab/fstab and friends is one-of-a-kind ancient mess.\n- it started with ancient BSD (not FreeBSD) function strunvis, which behaviour not documented. Probably that was OS-specific function (a la virtual methods). http://manpages.org/strunvis/3\n- when Linux was mimicking good old BSd it only made ad hoc substitutions for 4 specific chars. There is no any systematic/generic pattern at all.\n```\nstatic inline void mangle(struct seq_file *m, const char *s)\n{\nseq_escape(m, s, \" \\t\\n\\\\\");\n}\n```\nhttps://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/fs/proc_namespace.c#L84\n```\nR(\"\\\\\", '\\\\'),\nR(\"011\", '\\t'),\nR(\"012\", '\\n'),\nR(\"040\", ' '),\nR(\"134\", '\\\\')\n```\nhttps://sources.debian.org/src/sysvinit/2.96-6/src/fstab-decode.c/\nSo, whatever comes from Linux mounts information - should be de-mangled for those four special cases.\nEvery single space-separated column of every single line.\nUgly, and undocumented, but that is what it is. And, frankly, it is not that hard...\nBUT, why do you want to compare with some arbitrary hex-escaped string? what can be a real use-case for that???\nLinux kernel just does not have hex-escaping code for disk mounts.\nNow, to be frank, even this would NOT be enough, because i can have multiple disks with the same partition label. Like many USB thumb drives with \"DATA\" partition. I can even have several partitions with the same name on singe disk!\nAgain, it can be fixed by detecting collisions and adding extra data, like counters or GUID or whatever, but...\nWhat gonna OMV do if OMV's user has two drives with partitions having same labels, and then he hotplugs one disk, or another, or both in any order? Is it race condition now? Is it okay for OMV to have race condition?\nSeems whatever use cases Salt imagined for them here is very different from what OMV users might face.",

        "message": "Summary of the investigation at this point:\n* When the client restarts, the network hook's `Prerun` fires and tries to recreate the network and setup the iptables via CNI.\n* This fails because the netns already exists, as expected. So we tear down the task and start over.\n* But in the next pass when we setup the iptables via CNI, we collide with the iptables left behind.\n* To fix this we need the network namespace path (which is used by CNI as part of the handle for [`go-cni#Network.Remove`](https://godoc.org/github.com/containerd/go-cni#Network.Remove)).\n* In the non-Docker case, Nomad controls the path to the netns and it's derived from the alloc ID, but in the Docker case (which includes all cases with Connect integration b/c of the Envoy container), Docker owns that path and derives it from the pause container name. So we can't use a deterministic name as a handle to clean up. But we can't get it from Docker either because at the point we need it that container has already been removed.\nI've verified the following more common failure modes are handled correctly:\n* Tasks recover fully when the client restarts (after a few PRs we landed in the current 0.10.0 release branch)\n* There's no resource leak when the client restarts if the containers aren't removed.\n* There's no resource leak when the client restarts as part of a node (machine) reboot.\nStatus:\n* We could try to fix this by threading state about the network namespace from the allocation runner back into the state store, similar to how we deal with deployment health state. But this will always be subject to races between client failures and state syncs.\n* We already have a PR open for 0.10.x to reconcile and GC Docker containers. Because all the rules we're creating are tagged with the string \"nomad\" and Nomad's alloc IDs, we can make a similar loop for iptable GC.\n* Because I've verified that this leak doesn't happen in the common failure modes of a client or node reboot, we're not going to block the 0.10.0 release on this. We'll work up a PR for an out-of-band reconcile loop for 0.10.x.\nMoving this issue out of the 0.10.0 milestone.",

Not to be rude but I have stopped all of my app development with Avalonia simply because there is basic functionality that remains broken for years because new features or \"compatibility\" is favored over deprecating or changing things for the better. I like Microsoft, and their acquisition of things usually makes things better, but this workflow I'm describing benefits nobody and it just stalls development for everyone for years.\nMost of my bugs were filed in 2017-2019 and they still remain for the most part. I didn't even make reports for everything because they are so infuriating, or making a reproduction is just so time-consuming, or the issue is SO BASIC (ComboBoxes drive me insane in this) that I'm like \"surely they will find and fix this without my report\" so I just gave up. Whenever I NEED to update my stuff I end up spending the entire day diagnosing things that broke when updating (so the compatibility argument makes literally no sense since shit breaks anyway EVERY update without fail).\nI have janky extension methods and fixes everywhere in every app because again, basic functionality just does not work and I'm waiting for things to get fixed, or events fire in different orders between updates. It's just impossible to justify my day doing this literally every time. I'm glad there is a ContainsExclusive now as I suggested in my PR but it should be used where possible ASAP. Not in 8 months. Then I can remove my extension method that does that in PointerPressed.\nAnd people using my apps understand I have no motivation because of this. They see it's open source and want to help, then attempt to and go \"oh Avalonia with their 1000+ issues\" and try to port my stuff to GTK or something else since they also have issues with Avalonia. Again I don't want to be mean here but this is actual feedback you should consider seriously. You guys do hard work but the workflow is just not there where it matters. It's the hard truth and I wish it weren't since Avalonia can be so great, and should've been great a long time ago. But when ComboBoxes for example STILL don't perform as expected after 5+ years it really does hurt your users.\nI pull every commit locally since I first found Avalonia, even to this day, and I read them all. But I see only new features and macOS low-level window fixes. Nothing that matters to me personally, and I get disappointed every now and then since I see the priorities. Anyway, that's just my rant and my opinion. I hope this new generation of users can develop with less headache than I did.",

        "message": "@fragglet Thanks for taking the time to explain this further, I do really appreciate it. Though unfortunately I still don't feel any closer to really understanding the rationale to let one optional vanilla break exist but not another. Well, besides the *very* thin 'keeping Chocolate closer to Vanilla by not introducing more stuff'.\nI don't believe I've made any contradictions, or at least not in the way you were explaining I did. Maybe I didn't write it out adequately enough before, so I'll try to re-iterate it against the points you made to hopefully help clarify my point. The feature I'm suggesting would have absolutely no affect at all on the vanilla experience, outside of getting to actually *have the experience*. I definitely wouldn't side with any of the counter changes you suggested to mine. Increased frame rate, increased resolution, changed networking... those type of changes would affect the vanilla experience and definitely would be 100% against the philosophy document. Chocolate should only have changes that can give greater access and range to the vanilla experience, which I feel experiencing these otherwise vanilla compliant maps is perfectly acceptable; but *only* as something optionally! It *shouldn't* be the default behavior to accommodate limit breaking maps and I would fully agree with that. But I feel there is no reason there can't be an option to allow for using these maps so people can get the 'vanilla experience' with them. That's sort of what I feel is the entire point of Chocolate - bringing the vanilla experience into the present.\nI'm not quite sure why you feel the simpler approach I suggested for the limit raise would suddenly make the vanilla compatibility muddled for Chocolate. An array is still an array. An array created by a variable with the value of 127 would be exactly the same size as an array was created by a #define with the value of 127. So if the array sizes are defaulted to vanilla limits, I can't see how that muddles things in any way at all. Of course, if you explicitly tell it to muddle the limits, then obviously that would - akin to the demo and save limits. Though the more complicated approach of auto setting the limits I suggested, while still possible to do as arrays and get precisely the same vanilla behavior with defaults, would introduce a lot more non vanilla code; so I can understand that being a potential thumbs down at the very least.\nBut, it seems at this point though that we will likely just have to agree to disagree. It is only opinion vs. opinion now, and we appear to be unable to see eye to eye on the topic. Likely we will only waste each other's time trying to continue on. I'll just have to take some time over a weekend to make a tiny hack in a fork, and that'll be that. It is unfortunate though that the fork is even necessary for something so incredibly minor. But at least this way everyone else who also requested this feature can still use Chocolate Doom's exceptional vanilla experience and have the option play otherwise fully compatible maps as intended.\nI'll just close with thanking you again for taking the time to try and explain this further. And thank you and everyone else who worked on and created Chocolate. It really is quite exceptional and amazing software, even despite this hold back it insists to carry. I have used Chocolate as my choice Doom port for years, and is why I was particularly interested to try and understand why something I feel would fit it perfectly as a non-disruptive option, apparently cannot.",

Please know that we aren't ignoring you, nor are we happy to close your issues and never respond. Please have patience with us while we try to assist you and others. Thanks :heart: I'm happy to make a temporary fix to support the two parameter method for this third party plugin using an internal library to Vagrant, but as I mentioned yesterday you will likely get more traction and a quicker fix if you open an issue on the plugin side and fix it there. Our Vagrant release cadence isn't too frequent, and there are lots of other issues and features that we're trying to get in for each release.\nIf you wish to get this moving faster, there is already a pull request on the plugin: https://github.com/smerrill/vagrant-gatling-rsync/pull/37 I recommend pinging the maintainer on there.\nFor fixing this today on your side, you should still be able to use the built in rsync synced folder feature, as this is the recommended way to use rsync and Vagrant. Alternatively, downgrading to Vagrant 2.2.5 and using that plugin until a fix has been met is also a possibility. You could also bring in the changes locally and run and install the plugin from source.\nWe can leave this open to track the issue for now in case others find it. If our next release time comes around and it's still not fixed on their side, I'll apply a patch that fixes this so that it works in 2.2.7. Thanks!",

IndexFormatter works. It simply works, as intended, without any bug.\n2. ``IndexFormatter(x_labels)`` is far simpler than proposed convoluted alternatives like ``FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: dict(zip(range(len(x_labels)), x_labels)).get(x, \"\"))`` to achieve the same exact end result.\n3. The solution doesn't break back compatibility in the middle of minor revision. The users don't have to change their programs. They don't have to find an alternative. 4. It follows the precepts of semantic versioning instead of adopting post hoc rationalisations (like \"others deprecated functionalities in the middle of minor revision so lets pretend it's okay for us to do the same\")\n5. You don't have to spend time and energy changing the documentation. You don't have to teach the users alternative methods that are necessarily harder to implement and explain.\n6. Apparently, the DEPRECATION is based, at least partially, on the false assumption that a decade of zero complaints from the users somehow means the users are unhappy with IndexFormatter and therefore don't use it. 7. THE DEPRECATION misses entirely the point of avoiding the vicious cycle of complexity. Increasing complexity to achieving the same exact functionality is a huge waste of your time. It only make you busier and busier, writing more convoluted code and spending more time managing harder to debug bugs.\nI have wasted enough of my time trying to convince you. So be it.",

At this point it has nothing to do with any of the in-game aspects, it is entirely about the behaviour of the people championing it.\nWhile most of the competitive RA community are good people, there is a rotten core of toxic entitlement that manifests as abuse and belittlement, often focused around ERCC, and usually focused personally against me. This behaviour has forever soured ERCC, and integrating it into the upstream RA mod now would validate that behaviour as an effective strategy for influencing OpenRA's development.\nWhy now? Two recent incidents targeting me (from N/A in the community discord, and Longely/Widow in the competitive discord - the two main personalities behind ERCC) were incredibly offensive and belittling, and are the straw that has broken the camels back when added on top of many other generally toxic events this year. People in the competitive community were having fun meming about \"us vs the devs\" earlier this year, but at that time I was seriously considering quitting OpenRA completely due to how unhappy and embarrased the behaviour of some people in the community (and the general tolerance of that behaviour as acceptable by everybody else) was making me. Ultimately, I decided that I enjoy working on the project, and making things better for everybody else in the community. I *do not* enjoy interacting with the assholes, and intend to be increasingly blunt in dismissing their toxic behaviour. This is the first concrete action towards that.\nI can certainly appreciate the desire for solving directional map imbalance, to the point where I fully implemented the code for one solution (rotatable structures) and developed a working prototype for a second (allowing harvesters to dock from any direction, visually jumping docking point). I think there is scope for some ERCC alternative, but I suggest that the competitive community as a whole put some effort into solving its attitude problem before they try to revisit such ideas here.",

I don't know what would happen with GitHub automatic redirects in this case...\nIIUC the concern is only until the migration happens (i.e. until when both `master` and `main` exist and are in sync in nodejs/node), correct? We can plan a time for the migration (similarly to what we do with security releases and CI upgrades), communicate it, and then during that time we restrict push to this repo to those involved in the migration. Once the migration is completed, we restore push to `@nodejs/collaborators`, and ensure the branch protections for `master` only let the bot push to it. I _think_ we can even add a git hook for push to give collaborators a message telling them to use `main` instead of `master` when pushing (not entirely sure).\nAnother idea I have (which I've been thinking for a different repository/organization, is to use the `post-checkout` git hook to communicate every time someone checks out to master (and try to identify if it was ran on our CI etc). That would help us identify when usage of master branch drops enough for us to safely discontinue it.",

Specification:\nAdding a new command line argument to the server like --singlemix:\n- No multithreading (since we only have one encoding and mixing so no multithreading needed)\n- Only 128 sample frame size support\n- Only Mono support (gives us the most possible number of connected clients which is what this modification is all about)\n- The first connected client on that server is the \"director\", all other clients which connect afterwards get his mix. So you just have to make sure that the director is already connecting to the server before your session begins (this requirement should be very easily to be fulfilled).\nThere is a vecvecbyCodedData buffer which is used for both, encoding and decoding. I'll introduce a separate buffer so that I can re-use the output buffer of the first client for all other clients. So instead of calling MixEncodeTransmitData for all the other clients, they simply get vecChannels[iCurChanID].PrepAndSendPacket ( &Socket, vecvecbyCodedData[iDirectorID], iCeltNumCodedBytes );. I just did a quick hack: If I modify CreateChannelList so that no client is added, the audio mixer panel is just empty. This would be the case for the slave clients. But then they do not see how many clients are currently connected which is not a big issue. If \"--singlemix\" is given, \"-F\" and \"-T\" is deactivated and a warning is shown that these cannot be combined. In the OnNetTranspPropsReceived function we can check that the client uses 128 samples, if not, refuse to connect.\nThere is a new branch were the implementation is done:\nhttps://github.com/corrados/jamulus/tree/feature_singlemixserver",

And some whining, but that's par for the course.\nFirstly, there have been no comments by any team member either accepting or rejecting the service. Nor has there ever been a PR adding support that could be accepted or rejected. So any assumptions or accusations based on that are wrong. Some voices of reason questioned this, so thank you for that. Your comments were still marked off-topic because that's just the case on Github. Feel free to go off-topic galore in our IRC channel.\nSecondly, just like Bravenewpipe supports 2 additional services that Newpipe doesn't have, you can go all out and add whatever services you like to your own forks. Because FOSS. Or, you could _politely_ request the maintainers of a fork (there are at least 2) to add support. Because FOSS. But complaining about the supposed \"political views\" of team members won't suddenly make them 'see the light' or the 'error of their ways' and get them to drop everything to spend hours/days/weeks to add support for [insert your personal bandwagon service here] for free. Because FOSS. So there is no point in doing that, in this repo or in any FOSS project.\nFinally, Odysee unfortunately caters to misinformation: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-media-misinformation/\nIf you genuinely think that [insert your favourite content creator here] is not part of the misinformation camp and doesn't deserve to get blocked out merely because they use LBRY, consider persuading them to try Peertube. Not only will it potentially increase their viewers, but it would help them avoid the stigma associated with LBRY. And of course, you can add their instance, or one their chosen instance federates to, to Newpipe. (Just to be clear, this is not about superior tech, merely about exploring a platform that could help such creators out.)\nAnd now, some food for thought: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance\nService rejected.

In the past, we've had to type a help command or look at some personal bot website to understand the context of how they function, but now, that's all changed merely to a description for each option, each choice, and etc.\nIdealistically, the only thing that slashes commands should be different than the commands we can already create and implement into our own discord.py bots should be the UI, everything should in my eyes come natively. Guild/role permissions, requirements, no limit to choices for options, and etc. are many things that we are still waiting to seek for slash commands to receive, either via. un-official 3rd party support or by the developers at Discord themselves.\nBecause of this, I continue to believe that we should seek to be able to code slash commands as an actual usable thing for the discord.py library, not because they're something new and trendy, but simply because this library is an API wrapper in and of itself. The main purpose it overall serves is to help make the Bot API easier to use with Python, and by those means, we shouldn't limit ourselves from implementing slash commands as well. They may not be used as much as regular commands, for sure, but in the future, we won't have to worry about having to code it later than doing it now.

MAUI uses native SDKs and native tooling to produce builds.\nMAUI-XAML-multiplatform support is a different story.

Thanks for opening this feature request.\nThe current behavior is reflecting the long-standing behavior that Terraform does still detect and incorporate remote objects into the state, but then while producing a plan it ignores differences _between the configuration and the state_. The difference reported in your example is a difference between the prior state and the current remote object, and `ignore_changes` has never affected that situation but that fact was less visible before because Terraform just silently updated the state rather than reporting it.\nWhile it might seem immaterial whether Terraform updates the state or not here, it _can_ result in a change in behavior of your configuration if any other expressions in the module refer to that value. To be specific, if you had any reference to `aws_batch_compute_environment.batch_compute.compute_resources[0].desired_vcpus` elsewhere in your module then they would return `2` rather than `0` after detecting this change, and so that is what Terraform is reporting here, in case that ends up being useful context for understanding which actions Terraform proposes (or doesn't propose) in the plan.\nI assume that in your case this doesn't really matter much, because you _don't_ have any references to `aws_batch_compute_environment.batch_compute.compute_resources[0].desired_vcpus` elsewhere in your module and so you don't actually care what's reported in the state. One potential improvement we could consider for this mechanism is for Terraform to try to only report changes to resources that have other expressions referring to them, since changes to a value that nothing refers to can't possibly affect the behavior of the configuration.\nHowever, such a rule is easier to say than to implement because what we've done here is just expose in the UI some long-standing Terraform behavior that was previously invisible, and so changing that behavior at this late state will likely require a lot of research to make sure that the changes don't break use-cases we're not currently aware of. The current output is an honest and correct account of Terraform's behavior, and so I think we need to consider here whether the right thing to do is change Terraform's behavior (which, for something this fundamental, would be challenging to do at this late stage in Terraform's life) or to change the UI to fudge the details a little so that it leaves hidden some details that surface inconvenient truths that don't actually affect configuration behavior.\nWe won't be able to make any significant changes in this regard in the near future, because the scope of this project was just to be more explicit about what Terraform was already doing rather than to change how Terraform behaves, but we'll use this issue to represent the need and consider what we might change in future releases.\nThanks again!",

This is the approach I'm most in favour with because it allows this to be decided at runtime and to be varied flexibly across different use cases (i.e. running locally vs running in CI/CD platforms, etc.). It also provides users a simple way to revert to the old representation of the output.\n```console\n$ terraform plan --ignore-drifts\n$ terraform apply --ignore-drifts\n```\nIn addition, we could also implement this at a resource/module level using the `ignore_drifts` field. This may be helpful for some use cases where we might be interested drifts in general but not all fields.\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n# ...\nlifecycle {\nignore_drifts = [\netag, # Ignore drifts for specific attributes\n]\n}\n}\n```\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n# ...\nlifecycle {\nignore_drifts = all # Ignore drifts for all attributes\n}\n}\n```",

        "message": "Hi all! Thanks for all the feedback here.\nIt's clear that there are lots of opportunities to improve the signal to noise ratio of the current change detection. As I mentioned right back at the top of this discussion, this is Terraform making explicit some behaviors that were previously implicit and thus a common cause for confusion. However, it's also clear that various particular provider features, along with the historical confusing design of `ignore_changes`, have led to the new behavior being confusing in quite a different way.\nTwo specific things that the Terraform team is researching to improve this feature are:\n* A new feature that does what everyone _thinks_ `ignore_changes` does: declare that a particular resource attribute is not relevant to the current configuration and thus not interesting to track.\nWhat `ignore_changes` _actually_ does is tell Terraform to ignore changes _to the configuration_, which unfortunately means that it explicitly _doesn't_ ignore changes in the remote system (which is the source of record). We can't change the behavior of `ignore_changes` due to [the v1.0 compatibility promises](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/v1-compatibility-promises.html), but we _could_ introduce a new feature that makes a stronger statement, which would include making Terraform consider changes to it to be totally immaterial, and thus not mention them.\n* Heuristics to detect better whether any of the _proposed_ changes (the result of the plan) seem likely to have been caused by one of the _detected_ changes (the result of refreshing), and thus automatically effectively infer by static analysis which changes are relevant to report.\nThis would effectively be an automatic version of the explicit feature I described in the previous point, avoiding the need to explicitly annotate everything and instead saving explicit annotations only for situations that are too complicated for Terraform's static analysis to understand automatically.\nBoth of these features are cross-cutting and therefore not something we can just casually implement without careful design first. However, we are indeed actively investigating both and hope to have improvements to share in a forthcoming release.\nSince this discussion has got quite heated and it seems like we've already gathered sufficient feedback, I'm going to lock this discussion for now in order to reduce the noise for the many folks who are following this issue. We'll unlock it again when either we have more news to share or if we need some specific feedback in order to shape solutions like what I described above.",

To users that are on Windows 7, it is highly suggest you upgrade to Windows 10.\n> I was actually able to install the latest version for Windows normally a few weeks ago, despite my operating system being Windows 7\nYes, support has been dropped for Windows 7. You may be able to install it, however we have no plans to provide support for bugs/issues on Windows 7 devices.\n> * A chatterino7 release that is discrepant from the chatterino2 philosophy of not allowing non-logged in users to receive \"notify when online\" notifications (among other features)\nAs already mentioned, we are trying to move away from Kraken as a result of the API being decommissioned. Helix endpoints have a strict requirement for OAuth when trying to use any endpoint as per the API docs: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference. This is inclusive of knowing when a stream is online or not. Hence why you are unable to see if a stream is live (and do/see many other things) if you are not logged in.\n> * A chatterino7 release that supports Windows 7 (my understanding was that 2.1.0 was the last version to support Windows 7, but at some point that appears to've changed, so perhaps this is just a given)\nAs aforementioned, Microsoft has dropped all support for Windows 7. Why would we support Windows 7 if the developer doesn't themselves? It seems absolutely preposterous to me.\n> Is a Windows 7 user still able to have a functioning Chatterino above version 2.1.0?\nSure, it may work. We still don't provide support for it.\n> Also I feel it is dishonest of you to just refuse to acknowledge the quote I cited demonstrating the outright refusal to allow anonymous \"live checks\" even if it were possible for the foreseeable future. There is a difference between \"we could if we would\" and \"we refuse to\". You making a third choice for yourself of \"the choice is out of our hands\" is too late considering I cited a quote on chatterino's stance on this already.\nChatterino is a community-made, open source project. Nobody gets paid to work on it. I'll put it quite simply; Kraken is not being added into Chatterino, just so users are able to see when a streamer is live in anonymous mode.\nYour whole issue revolves around complaining that there's no Windows 7 or Kraken support. Both of which have had all support dropped by their main developers. So I ask you; why would we add support for said feature, if the devs themselves do not support it?\nKind Regards,\nALazyMeme",

        "message": "Inspired by the steam forum topic \"Convoluted\" by Chelle, and a prompt by Developer Gadsby to post feedback,\nthis is a Quality Assurance Write-up Complaint about everything bad, unintuitive, convoluted, and otherwise\nin need of serious QA (Quality Assurance) love. Retroarch NEEDS to up their QA to be able to act as a platform\nfor emulators. This post is meant to be intentionally hyper-critical and nitpicky on first world problems, because the experience is just that annoying. I hope to point out to readers many problems with the readability of Retroarch, and it's common user experience. I also hope if taken seriously, i get a contributor interested enough by my points, to add me and talk to me on discord, so we can work together on bringing retroarch up to a level people expect it to be at, and help retroarch hit console or platform level quality it is so desperately missing.\n==================Chapter 0: I Didn't Even Launch It Yet And I Have Complaints=================\nNote: If you are only contributor level and not developer level, scroll down and skip to chapter 1.\nI'm going to start by looking at retroarchs website and steam page, and boy, before we even launch retroarch\nfor the first time, there a lot to talk about already. Infact, to even do this write up, or rather to attempt to\ntalk about it on the issues section on github i was pointed to, it says this is for bug reports only.\nCurrently, i'm under the assumption i'm already somehow breaking the rules by doing what i was told.\nNot a good start, but not the worst. With that out of the way that i'm posting here on request, and not out\nof ignorance for the warning github gives new posts, lets move on.\nLets look at the Website and steam page front pages. I kind of want to talk about them both at once.\nI'll start with the opening description on both. It's to technical. Retroarch as i see it, is looking to be\na platform, like steam, to access things. Like the playstation XMB, or switch home screen. For a description,\non the site we get \"RetroArch is a frontend for emulators, game engines and media players.\" and on steam \"RetroArch is an open source and cross platform frontend/framework for emulators, game engines, video games, media players and other applications\"\nThis actually tells a user very little about what retro arch is, and isn't. Even people emulator savvy won't\nunderstand the rest of what is being thrown at them. a 'frontend' for emulators? lets google frontend. \"frontend can refer to any hardware that optimizes or protects network traffic.\" People aren't playing these\nonline, or it's not their first thought. They don't need protection from the net when playing mario. Okay,\nmaybe a smart person will think it has multiple definitions, and google more accurately. lets google Frontend Program\n\"A Front End developer (dev) works with designers and Back End devs to create a website\" Well, retroarch\nisn't a website (Well technically it is but you know what i mean), it's a program itself. Already, using the\nterm frontend is to much. If you want retroarch to really succeed, to shine, you need to make it marketable and understandable. The optics matter, if people don't know what it is, they won't know why they should care\nabout being interested in it. when people say it's convoluted, you shouldn't need an 30 minutes of research\nto even understand your opening sentences.\nit also says 'game engines, and media players'. Why? Lets be honest, retroarch runs emulators. Thats what it\ndoes. Why do you need to complicate this? Does it run other things sure, but nobody is seriously wanting it as their number 1 music player or picture taker. why can't you speak english? the steam page says emulators,\nso someone knew that word, why aren't these two sources on the same page for their advertising? Unfortunately\nthe steam page then says game engines, video games, media players, and other apps.\nWhat fucking goon is downloading retroarch just to play music. This is not a good use of advertising space.\nThe human being looking at your steam page can see the music menu in your advertising images. Use your text\nspace better, seriously!!! Why is this so hard! Also, it says emulators, then game engines, then video games.\npick ONE! these are all synonyms in practicality. People also don't need to know it's open source\nin your intro, you can say that later. From what i've later come to understand, the devs want to use the term 'Core'. They want this because they believe in what retroarch does aside from emulators. Sure, except...the opening advertisement doesn't say 'Core'. Here is a good opener. \"RetroArch is a all in one platorm for Emulation that enhances the games you play\nand other Cores. From retro era to modern games, you can even play online with friends!\" This is a fantastic, easy to digest, explanatory, to the point advertisement that tells people what\nretroarch is, what it DOES (Enhances emulator games), and avoid words like \"nintendo\" or \"platstation\" for\ncopywrite while still getting the \"old to current\" idea across. Make your text readable to people! If they want more\nthey can hit up a FAQ. Note: Going forward, i will be referring to a reasonable way to read something, or\na problem with text that is to jargin-driven as \"Readability\" as a unbrella term. This will come up A LOT\nand will be a serious problem with retroarch in nearly every part of anyones experience. Please remember this.\nLets move on. in the websites next section, it says you can run original game discs, but steam says the feature isn't out yet. These are literally giving conflicting information. Seriously? ITS YOUR FRONT PAGE!\nNext, lets look at some visuals here. For the website, i want to look at the \"A polished Interface\" Slide.\nThis makes it look like playstation, cool. Except this isn't what it looks like in retroarch by default.\nMake it clear in advertising this is a skin. Also, ironically, the interface is excessively NOT polished, but\ni will be getting to that as a major complaint in another chapter. But right now, it's a skin, say it's\na skin. The very idea their not saying its not the default skin here, implies someone knew it was terrible and\ntried to hide it. Maybe ask why they needed to hide your real interface? We will get to that later...\nMoving back to steam, lets look at the slides/image roll. First is the trailers. All three are really fucking bad.\nTrailer 1: its a fun logo (sure, fine) then shows the menu with garbage readability that makes a person\nwant to flee just looking at it, followed by showing what has GOT to be one of the WORST POSSIBLE game examples.\nlike, you CANNOT be serious. the website slides show mario, and this trailer has a level ID called zero / megaman129. Show us a actual video game. Make the trailer show like 8+ games of different genres. Make it CLEAR that retroarch plays VIDEO GAMES, and not, whatever the fuck that is. Bad advertising affects\nend user readability to understand what retroarch is and is not. and this is contributing to why you get topics\nsaying people are confused about retroarch.\nTrailer 2: Literally a logo. Why is this here? Remove it.\nTrailer 3: This feels like a meme. Seriously, this is cruel, it hurts. It's like someone took what makes a good intro video and butchered it to the max. No BGM, no person explaining things, no examples\nof games being played, it's super fast (Epilepsy educing even?). So fast you can't even read all the text\nwithout pausing the video. Please make a real trailer. Look at like, any nintendo direct. Do that, but for retroarch. Show off and explain lots. I'll help QA it if you need someone. We can improve this.\nThen the steam slides, their mostly the exact same menu. Why? Why not Show off various parts of retroarch? Actually make people interested. Your telling me you create all of retroarch, and the only part\nyou want people to know about is 2 screens? wtf? Now i can go on, but the pre-retroarch experience is getting comically long at this point.\nI'll move onto actual retroarch, but rest assured, i can REALLY go on about whats wrong before even downloading.\nIn summary\n1: Very poor readability\n2: Poor advertising\n3: Bad use of space\n4: inconsistent between steam and website\n5: Doesn't actually say what retroarch does in words people can understand let alone google. ===============Chapter 1: \"A Polished Interface\"? Actually It's Really Fucking Garbage======================\nNote: I have gotten some responses to points in this chapter from users using custom alternate skins for\nRetroArch that change how the menu actually functions and displays information, and not just the visuals.\nThis chapter is about a first time experience, and as such uses the default skin. Before i actually talk about the REAL first impression, i want to point out i downloaded website and steam\nboth, to check for differences. Guess what? The first impression is diffrent. Inconsistent again? Ugh.\nFrom website, it launched windowed, and you lack the cool cursor, and get the ultra low quality windows\nmenu that feels like a 2005 program with file/command/windows despite that retroarch has it's own in-app menus.\nThis doesn't happen on steam, it launches in fullscreen on first boot. The difference here is very important.\nNot everyone knows you can Alt+Enter programs to fullscreen them. Infact, this is semi-rare info. This is made worst by F11 being the windows default to fullscreen, but boy do i wish complaining ended here.\nIf a non-steam user tries to fullscreen by hitting F11, retroarch hotkeys this to swapping between the windows\nand custom cursor. Now, the custom one looks good, but it locks you into the windows. Surely you can\nmake your cursor not get locked, come on. But even worse, is when someone wants out and presses F11 again. I CANNOT BELIEVE how bad this is. If you are multi-monitor, your cursor is now locked to the monitor\nretroach was in itself, untill you move retroarch. Clickin on it, pressing hotkeys ect won't fix this.\nI don't mean using the retro cursor, i mean normal windows cursor, you can't leave your moniter. what the actual fuck? what a joke! I haven't even talked about retroarch contents directly, and\ni can barely type up this QA review because retroarch literally won't let my cursor go click on notepad. >:(\nit gets worse. If your fullscreen and press F11, your cursor doesn't change, but your mouse still can't\nleave the moniter. The user would have no idea why and think retroarch is just a bad program. How can\nyou have this many errors and i'm not even talking about retroarch itself yet?????\nOKAY, actual retroarch time. You can argue before this, thats a unintended bug, sure. Lets looks at whats NOT a bug.\nSo, we boot into the main menu that is...lacking readability at best. \"Load Core\"? Why? these things are called emulators, call them emulators. \"Load Emulator\" is perfectly reasonable English. It's my understanding the devs want the term\nCores because it also uses something called Cores in addition to emulaitors. Sure, but you want to be\na marketable, understandable program? speak in words people actually understand. it's my understanding the team personally wants 'Load Core / Content' as they want to do more then emulators. In counter to this, i have 2 suggestions. Either split the menu AND load between Emulators (Load Emulaitor / Game), and other Cores (Load Core / Content), or make the load\nbutton hidden untill a emulaitor or core is ready, then have it show Load Game or Load Content based on what Emu/Core\nis loaded! Easy! Also, this menu is bloated.\nSo, 1: Split the cores menu, between \"Cores\", and a new one called \"Emulators\"\n2-1: In addition to Load Content, add a new menu called Load Game right under Emulators.\n2-2: Or, make load content/game hidden until a emulator or core is loaded in already.\n3: Also change Esc defaulting to exiting the program, to a back button. This is semi-common, and straight up default\nin nearly every PC game. If your a platform on a PC for people gaming on a PC, use a PC control scheme. wtf?\nthere is a quit button if needed, and Alt+F4 or Alt+Enter, we don't need to troll PC users with a comically\nbad default control scheme thats normally a menu button on almost every pc video game ever released.\n\"Bloated\" i'm going to define, as to many things being in one menu, or things being in the wrong location.\nHere, we have the main menu showing config, info, and help. But we have a left side bar. whats the difference between config and settings? this is already a readability problem, they can be seen as synonyms. Now, i'm gonna be going all over unfocused here, because there is so many problems their all interwoven.\nThe Config file menu, why is this a menu? 1: Delete the Config menu entry\n2: Move the contents of the config menu, to the top of the settings menu. 3: Why is help a menu with only 1 content? Literally delete this menu.\n4: Move Menu Controls and it's icon to the bottom left of retroarch below the white line. This menu is first of all stupid and should probably be removed entirely, however...\n4-2: Rename Menu Controls to Controller and have this lead directly to the input menu. If you really want,\ninclude the Menu controls in Controller, but really it's common sense, and people can customize this,\nso the stated controls in Menu Controls can literally lie to the user, this is dumb.\n5-1: on first startup, maybe do a first time setup that asks the user what menu icons they would like.\nlet them pick from switch, xbox, playstation, ect. Its also kinda bad to display Switch by default, but\nuse american playstation input scheme, and not having a switches A button actually be A. Readability issues!!!!!\n5-2: If that is a copywrite problem, alternatively let people customize the on-screen symbols with letters. In this way,\npeople can recreate their console of choice setup while working around looking like it clones a competitor, because\nit's a customization option of a user. And don't tell me customization options aren't fair game when your straight up\nstealing the playstation home menu theme >_>\nNow that thats done, we have a nice (enough) looking home. Onward to settings. The entire thing is bloated. There is also a lot of 2-menus required trolls. There are so many times you look in one menu and need to google to find another menu, it's not even funny. 1: First up, just like the white line at the bottom of retroarch, i recommend a new break line in the middle\nof settings. Things below it will be advanced settings, and title the section Advanced. Alternatively, if\nthis won't translate well to alternate skins, instead have a menu in here called Advanced at the bottom of settings.\nRename Saving to Saving Games (Readability, this seems like save Retroarch settings when it's here like this!)\n2: Throw logging, File Browser, On-Screen Display, AI Service, Latency, into Advanced.\n3: Delete the entire power management menu. wtf is this? It's literally empty. LITERALLY, USELESS. WHO????\n4: Rename Network to Online, or Online Multiplayer. (Readability!)\n5: Rename Input to Controllers\n6-1: On the left bar, Rename Import Content to \"Create Playlist\" (Because that is literally what it does)\n6-2: Move the playlists menu into the now named \"Create Playlist\" menu, de-bloat settings, so only people who care about the playlist menus are forced to see and scroll past this option. 6-3: Add a button named \"More Information on Playlists\" or maybe \"Playlists Tutorial\" or similar as well\nto explain what is a 'Playlist', how to set them up, needing cores/emulators, ect.\n6-4: if a Scan to create a playlist in a directory comes up empty, have a pop up explaining why. (Missing cores, ect)\n7: I cannot believe you have a menu called configuration here, when i earlier talked about configuration in\nthe main menu. Why do you have 2 config menus, and a settings menu? HELLO? This is so troll, the\nconfig options in settings/config effect your stuff in main menu/config. Why the fuck are they not together?\nWho designed this? *Phew* now that thats done.....\n7-1: In this submenu, move 'Use Global Core Options File' to the 'Load Core' Menu we are renaming to 'Load Emulator'.\n7-2: We are also renaming this option \"Use Global Emulator Options\".\nReadability is very important! 7-3: Finally, If (hopefully) Main menu config is moving to settings, either delete this Configuration menu, and move its only remaining option (Save Config on Quit) to settings, or move the config stuff from main menu, inside this config sub-menu. 8: AGAIN with the 2 menus needed trolls. Inside Directory we have a lot of playlist stuff, why?\n8-1: In playlist menu (that we are moving to the menu in point 6 we are calling \"Create Playlist\" Menu) create a new menu called Playlist Directories\n8-2: Move everything playlist related from settings/Directory to Music/Playlist Directories. This is to de-bloat menus with unnecessary information overflow, and put settings in menus they are actually\nused in, like any other emulaitor (PCSX2/RPCS3/Citra/Cemu/Yuzu/ect)\n9: Speaking of multiple same named menus, we have achievements, and a users achievements. STOP DOING THIS!!!!\nwhy do you want people to need to google one menu doesn't work without the other menu! THIS IS SO TROLL, STOP IT!\n9-1: Rename User to Account Settings & Achievements\n9-2: Move the achievements menu into this newly named menu to de-bloat settings, and put this in a reasonable spot.\n9-3: The Accessibility menu only has 1 option in it. Stop having troll 1 option menus. Delete this menu\n9-4: Rename the Sub-menu \"Accessibility Enable\" To \"Text to Speech\"\n9-5: Move \"Text to Speech\" to the Account Settings & Achievements, so one user can use it, and\nanother different user doesn't have to deal with troll text to speech in their ears. 10: Continuing from 9, we have streaming options in account, and them in recording. WHY.\n10-1: Rename \"Recording\" to \"Recording & Live Streams\"\n10-2: move the the content of the now \"Account Settings & Achievements\" / Account / Retroachievements to\nthe Achievements menu that was moved here in part 9. 10-3: The Youtube/Twitch/Facebook Gaming sub-menus only have 1 content, STOOOP FUCKINGGG DOOOING THIIIIS. >:((((\nwe are deleteing these sub-menus. 10-3: Move the menus inside the Youtube/Twitch/Facebook Gaming sub-menu stream key options from here, to the now named \"Recording & Live Streams\" menu. 10-4: in the \"Recording & Live Streams\" menu/Streaming Quality, give one of those grey sub-descriptions.\nSomething like \"Suitable for 720P Streams\" \"For 1080P Streams\" Ect. 10-5: Also rename the menu to Stream Quality.\nOh boy, onto input (that we said we are renaming to Controller)\n11-1: Move Maximum Users to...somewhere. Wtf even is this menu? If this actually means users, move it to the\nrelevant online menu. If it means locally, rename this to \"Maximum Controllers\". 11-2: If the later, Create one of those Advanced Options line breaks again at the bottom, and move this\ndown there, along with every other option in this menu untill we get to Menu Controls. 11-3: MENU CONTROLLS? HELLO? Why does main menu get help on menu controlls, BUT WE HAVE A ACTUAL MENU CONTROLS MENU? PUT RELEVANT MENUS IN RELEVANT PLACES THANK YOU.\n11-4: Move the Automatic Mouse Grab option to the Video menu in Settings. This is something usually in that\nmenu on other programs, stop being unintuitive!!! How can you make so many mistakes!!!\nSpeaking of the Video menu, lets tackle that next.\n12-1:in Fullscreen Mode, rename Windowed Fullscreen to \"Borderless Fullscreen\" or just \"Borderless\",\nand change the description appropriately.\n12-2: Rename Fullscreen Width & Height to \"Custom Width\" (& Height). It's already in the fullscreen sub-menu, you don't need to remind them what menu they are in, it's at the top of the screen!\n12-3: Move CRTSwitchRes and Output below the Fullscreen and Windowed sub-menus. Order matters! Most important\nthings go on top!\nI can keep going, but i'll stop here. This is a Serious Checklist of Readability improvements across the entire settings menu. However, if i reconsider, i may suggest adding Controller to the left bar as a major\nmenu instead, as it's reasonab;y so important, it should be a major menu, rather then some garbage like Music.\n=====================Chater 2: A Smoothe Gameplay Experience? Or A Troubleshooting Nightmare?=====================\nBefore i get into further details on games, i strongly recommend a new setting somewhere, on by default, that\nmakes it so when you load a game, and pick a emulaitor (Remember, we are calling these Games and Emulaitors, NOT\nCores and Content) that it associates that game to that emulaitor by default. In the future, you should be\nable to Load game -> Pick the game -> it just boots up without needing to pick a emulaitor. I...HOPE i don't have to explain how bad it is that steam retroarch is missing a download button. I will skip\nover the easy wall of text on this and move forward.\n1: For steam users, there should still be a download emulaitor button, but as a submenu. 1-1: In here, There should be a link to your website with a list of emulaitors to download.\n1-2: There should be a setting here, or in the Install Emulaitor menus to set the directory for cores.\nThis is because this options is only useful & relevant right at this moment, and never again, so it\ndoes not need to be in the directroies menu elsewhere.\n2: When in-game, move the Command/Menu button to the top of the list. I also feel a menu rename is in order, but can't think of one right now, and want to move on.\n3-1: Add save state and load state to the Command menu. Yes i know they are in the F1 menu. Make them accessable.\n3-2: In the F1 menu, move State slot below load state\nAnd oh boy, lets get into the F1 menu. In no particular order...\n4-0: Make it WAY more obvious to assign a button or combo to open this menu from controller.\nprobably include it in the quick menu directly at the bottom, even if the option exists somewhere else,\njust duplicate it. 4-00: Also, Escape should open the quick menu by default\n4-1: Originally i said Rename Information to Game Information, but i forgot i was still allowing for cores/content menus before.\ni now suggest making this menus name be contextual, based on if a emulator, or core is loaded. This way people only using\nemulators can have it reasonably say 'Game Information' and those who use cores still get 'Information' so it\ndoesn't clash with any development team desires.\n4-2: Move the Controller menu to right below Close Content\n4-3: Also rename that to Close Game\n4-4: Adding something to favorites and you can't remove it? WHY? Make this menu change to Remove from Favorites if it's a favorite >_>\n4-5: Remove the descriptions for Resume, Restart, and Close game. This screen has lots the player wants\nto see and not enough screen space even when in fullscreen. 4-6: Also remove descriptions on save state, load state, Take Screenshot, Cheats, Achievements, and Rewind.\n4-7: (Someone gave a good point against this, nevermind)\n4-8: Make it so if the player presses cancel in the F1 to go to Main Menu, Then cancel again, it resumes the game.\n4-9: move Show Desktop Menu from Main Menu while ingame to somewhere else (Probably settings).\nWith that out of the way, once ingame, there is no menu option to go back!\nAdd a button in windowed mode to open back the retroarch menu. If you tell me it's a hotkey, i don't care.\nthats not intuitive! Make a button to go back to the retroarch menu!!!\nFinally, this SHOULD be obvious, but it's not, so i will say it here.\nI assume this is a major feature, but really, let people access that emulaitors settings when using it.\nif we can't do that, retroarch is just worse then every emulaitor, because they have settings you NEED to even\nrun some games. If this option DOES exist, it's EXTREMELY hidden!\nMoving on, post gameplay, your recent games don't show up in load content / load game.\nWhy isn't there a recent games list? And why can't you set a content / game directory in directories? If you can, that option should 100% be in the load content / Load Game menu, as this is where\nit's actually relevant!!!\n=======================Ending==================\nI'll stop here, it's been 3 hours of complaints, but retroarch is riddles with terrible quality.\nWhy would anyone want to use this? 1: An unfun troubleshooting experience in exchange for playing games in the worst quality possible without access to emulators settings. 2: Some games are literally unplayable in retroarch because you can't access emu settings\n3: The menus are bloated, and lie / decieves / give half truths by hiding relevant other options in other menus\nfor no other reason then to troll you. The overall feeling is Retroarch is giving you the run-around, asking you\nto do something in some menu you don't know where it is, and when you find it, wants another setting in\nanother menu you don't know where it is. 4: it's a pain to setup even for simple emulators\n5: you can't even understand what retroarch is or isn't from inconsistent and contradictory messages,\nto near moon-rune levels of advertising.\n6: unintuitive menus and lacking default settings mean you need to go over everything before even attempting\nto test a single title.\n7: Using it via steam is a whole extra nightmare that could be made easy if anyone actually fucking cared.\nIt's easy to see why people don't recommend recroarch. The real question is if anyone is going to actually\ndo anything about it, or delete this post / no reply / no one for me to directly work with in a timely fashon /\nstick their head in the clouds and ignore why people don't enjoy their product. My discord is Dawnbomb#3408, and i'm open to any actual developer contacting me and working hand in hand for\nsome actual quality assurance before the steam deck launches, but considering how obvious, easy, and\nnear intensionally-troll the levels of design are here, i expect no contact and noone willing to work to make\nretroarch not be complete fucking bullshit bloatware on a PC, and i only scratched the surface of this QA nightmare.\n====================Chapter 3: Extra add-ons i thought of later=========================\nNote: Some of the things here delve closer to more serious changes to retroarchs codeing.\nStill, their good changes.\n1: Controller backround input should be in the input (Hopefully named Controller) Menu, not in another menu (User Interface).\nSetting up controller input in your controllers, then having if the actual input happens be decided in a separate menu, is another weird location problem.\n2: While im at it, Turbo Fire should be a setting INSIDE a controllers port controls. This would allow each controller to have separate turbo settings per player. 3: Altho highly unusual, some players enjoy playing games with two people one controller mode. Some people even go so far as to speedrun like this. Allowing multiple controllers assign buttons to the same button on the same port of a input would go a long way in support for those people.",

Sorry, but I simply don't understand your dismissive attitude towards @brad0. It is not his job to debug and fix the issue.\nAnyway, back to the issue. `/var/etc/radvd.conf` is cleared during the update, even tho in the web gui configuration looks ok, one need to change something, save and change back to regenerate `radvd.conf`. And @megmug seems to confirm that. Once you start digging it is easy to fix, but I guess you can agree that desynchronized settings in gui/system is not something that is immediately seen as a solution. And not everyone like @brad0 have to know how to fix that.\n> That makes absolutely no sense. Who broke things?\n@brad0: They did... You did nothing wrong. Upgrade process broke your settings.",

If I use an assembly redirect to 107, it won't work because it won't find IRestClient and if I use 106, my code won't work because the method signatures changed.\nI'm not sure what I would have done differently but perhaps something as simple a a different nuget package with different namespaces and mark the old one as deprecated.

At that point they're functional tests. next line goes into that;\n> As RestSharp uses HttpClient internally, it certainly uses HttpMessageHandler. Features like delegating handlers allow you to intersect the request pipeline, inspect the request, and substitute the response. You can do it yourself, or use a library like [MockHttp](https://github.com/richardszalay/mockhttp)\nthis requires me to actually know how you're making your calls inside your library that you publish to nuget. The main reason people wants to use external libraries is to not be concerned about the internals of that external code. It also assumes I know to use this MockHttp library (had no idea it existed, I didnt need to since I've used RestSharp to handle all \"HttpClient\" related things so far), with the assumption that, that package will also be maintained properly and will not be making breaking changes.\n> Mocking an infrastructure component like RestSharp (or HttpClient) is not the best idea.\nThis statement is also wrong in my opinion. I think the opposite actually, making us test external library code in our _unit_ tests implicitly makes them not unit tests, because we are always testing more than a small \"unit\" of code, in addition to our code change, now we're testing your code.\n> As RestSharp uses HttpClient internally\nWhat happens when you decide to not use HttpClient, but use \"MyGrandmasHttpClient\". Do we then have to refactor all of our code bases with the \"MockMyGrandmasHttpClient\" package?\nI am fine with removing every other interface on this package. Except for that single one.\nThis wouldn't be an issue if we were able to mock classes like Java allows, however removing this 1 single interface with 1 single method causes design issues, as well as wasted hours for millions of developers. I would also be skeptical about the suggested \"if you don't like 107, just remain on 106\" By it's nature, RestSharp deals with connectivity, that increases the chances of 0 day vulnerabilities or other security issues. We won't be able remain on 106 forever, and would be forced off of this package.

Do we then have to refactor all of our code bases with the \"MockMyGrandmasHttpClient\" package?\nThat's an exaggeration. RestSharp uses elements of .NET under the hood, and for many years it was `WebRequest`. Then, Microsoft decided to scrap it and re-implemented it using `HttpClient`, causing massive problems. Essentially, RestSharp uses the only way available in core .NET to make HTTP calls, and it's `HttpClient` until Microsoft decides to do something else. All other .NET libs for making HTTP calls like Refit or Flur also use `HttpClient`, and most people use `HttpClient` directly. So, when _that_ changes, all the code for .NET will need to change, which is very unlikely.\n> This statement is also wrong in my opinion.\nThe issue here is that by creating an interface mock you will assert if the client is formed according to your idea of how it should be formed. However, it doesn't guarantee that the actual HTTP request will be valid. That's why `HttpClient` has no interface and cannot be mocked. And that's why people normally use a test version of `HttpMessageHandler` instead, as `HttpClient` itself is just forming a message, but the actual _oevr the wire_ implementation is in the handler. See this [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36425008/mocking-httpclient-in-unit-tests).\n> I have to disagree with this. I don't think calling actual services from unit tests is good practice.\nYou don't have to call the actual service, you can call a simulation. That's what many RestSharp tests do for making sure that the server can understand the request in the way it should.\nAgain, I am not against bringing the interface back, but it won't be the original interface. Essentially, there are just a handful of core functions of the client itself (`ExecuteAsync` is the main one), all the others are just extensions.\nI actually think that the interface would help for building something like a retryable client with Polly, as it could be done in a wrapper using composition.",

I understand that any decision is ultimately in the hands of IPython maintainers, and respect their right to choose whatever they find works best for their project.\nI think having an option to auto-format code in the CLI and Jupyter cells is terrific. That being said, it being the default is rallying people against auto-formatting so it's somewhat counterproductive to what we want to achieve.\nNote that I don't necessarily agree with taking any change to Python, or third-party projects like in this case, hostage to some nebulous case of \"educating new users\". It's trivial to demonstrate semicolon usage and other changes which would be auto-formatted away. In fact, it would be also educational to inform users **why** those things are getting auto-formatted away. Semicolons and backslashes are pretty uncontroversially discouraged in user code, no?\nI know that the biggest point of contention is standardizing double quotes. I don't want to reopen the single quotes discussion but [the choice was made after evaluating both variants](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/51#issuecomment-376204207). Saying that \"Python itself prefers single quotes\" is anthropomorphicizing a piece of software. It's silly. Again, educating new users would be more complete with an explanation of the reasons why standardizing quotes is done and why one is better than the other.\nBut I digress. The more important issue is auto-formatting scientific math-heavy lines. There isn't much that can be magically done by a simple tool like Black here *in a consistent manner*. We are evaluating improvements in this area, specifically in the most often brought up case of [hugging power operands](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/2726).

I tried a few time to say I was considering making it default and only got positive feedback. So I did it, with extensive alpha, beta, and RC time to complain and ask for modifications.\nSo here is my challenge, if I don't make it the default, no-one know about it. It's astonishing that no-one found the bug @ehamiter described above in 2 years ! That alone would have definitely delayed the release, and at least I would have had tried to fix it.\nI've also seen a number of new users misformating Python code and taking really bad habits in the Repl, including folks that did not even realise IPython terminal was multiline. For many of those users black by default is much better. You get use to proper code formatting. So you learn to properly _read_ python code.\nAnd it is much easier to deactivate something you don't like than even figure out it something that may exists. For many users this benefits to, having this option be opt-in would make black auto formatting be part of the [unknown unknowns].(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns). So I will _never_ get feedback from these.

Since enabling `black` auto-formatting, I have found my own data processing to be 200% more legible (and has made typos, bugs and flaws 500% more obvious).\nBeyond the toll on tech debt and throughput, needing to worry about the \"proper\" way to format code has a real psychological toll. An analyst once handed off a notebook containing a few hundred lines of code. They apologized for the \"how bad\" their code was. Literally all I had to do was run, `black-nb`, and suddenly I was staring at some of the most careful, clever and well-constructed python I'd ever seen, albeit with a ton of copy-paste (DRY would arguably have been an antipattern for this use case).\nSimilarly, I set up all of our team repos--including where we store our \"lab notebooks\"--to run black (and isort) via pre-commit. I expected the junior team members to struggle with that. Instead, the feedback I received was gratitude that they didn't really have to learn or worry about all the various PEP8 rules; and relief that they didn't have to apply a dozen formatting rules during PRs.\nIn these ways, `black`-by-default leads not only to an essentially free jump in code quality and an easy ramp for new python programmers to get comfortable with the language's code conventions, but a demonstrable _empowerment_ of coders of all skill and experience levels to feel confident that their code is worthy of sharing without feeling self-conscious just because they don't always know the best place to put line breaks.\nThank you, IPython team, for doing this. This is a huge step for software integrity and for making python more accessible to the vast majority of programmers and python users who will benefit from having linted code out of the box.

Why not a %web_config that does like fish or xonsh and pop-up a web-browser that let you pick options (hey it can even be made as a separate package), or have a TUI client.\nAlso please stop hitting or vilifying anybody, and please help testing downstream project by making sure CI tests are run with `--pre` and similar, there are much better way to spend our time by making sure everything works well for everybody.",

If the operator is doing questionable actions with his powers then that's on Dream and I because we trusted the wrong person to be staff. And if any player complains about this because we would gain full access to their AE, i want to say that we can bypass it in several ways, the most convoluted one being direct nbt edit from server files.

suspect it is the same on WireGuard, but I have not tried that as I do not have access to a WireGuard VPN as of now) on a qBitTorrent app hostPath mounts are not mounted properly (also tried PVC, that didn't work either). The connection works (the logs show the VPN IP, not my IP), and adding and downloading torrents works, it just doesn't download them to my torrent dataset, making them inaccessible. This exact same configuration with VPN disabled works as intended, just without the VPN.\n**To Reproduce**\n<!--\n- make sure that if you follow these steps again yourself the bug happens again. if it doesnt its probbly a configuration error and should be handled with a support thread on the discord\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1.

[Required]\nYou still see this issue?: Yes\n### Make sure to visit the [wiki FAQ](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/FAQ) before requesting a feature.\nYou visited the wiki?: Yes\n### If your requested feature is with compiling a document (not having to do with finding the root file of a project), check first that you can compile manually.\nYou can compile a TeX document manually?: Yes\n## Is your requested feature related to a problem? Please describe. [Required]\nI have two docs in a structure like this:\n```\nD:\\BUG\n\u2502 bug.code-workspace\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500doc1\n\u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500.vscode\n\u2502 settings.json\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500doc2\n```\nI open both docs in one VS Code window. This is what `bug.code-workspace` is for.\nIn `doc1`, I would like to set a few settings that I do not want to apply to `doc2`. This is what `doc1/.vscode/settings.json` is for, and it looks like this:\n```json\n{\n\"editor.wordWrapColumn\": 88,\n\"latex-workshop.latexindent.args\": [\n\"-c\",\n\"%DIR%/\",\n\"%TMPFILE%\",\n\"-y=defaultIndent: '%INDENT%'\",\n\"-l\",\n],\n}\n```\nSo far, so good. However, this is not working because `latex-workshop.latexindent.args` is window-scoped, while `editor.wordWrapColumn` is resource-scoped. In line with that, the setting is greyed out and not applied:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12128514/153915001-83c233fe-c102-4f57-b00d-16e5d49028fb.png)\nThe reason is that the setting is not properly scoped - it has `window` scope:\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/6136c815bc6e7b99ec2dac56dccb3869574d2dd8/src/vs/workbench/contrib/preferences/browser/preferencesRenderers.ts#L596-L603\nAnd the reason for that is that it does not have an explicit scope at all, so it falls back to `window` - see https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points:\nhttps://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/blob/04f73108e439661faef2c8f85eac7baacbdb736b/package.json#L1810-L1822\nThis is certainly not intentional - I see no reason for this setting to (necessarily) be the same for all resources in a window. It should be able to differ by resource (folder).\n## Describe the solution you'd like [Required]\nThe fix is simple: set the scope for `latex-workshop.latexindent.args` (and probably other settings as well) to `resource`.

I'm trying to make my own injector. I want to process buffers, that aren't translated by ViaVersion yet. It would be better if ViaVersion had a separate outgoing handler which were called after the vanilla minecraft encoder. Your handler can expect bytebufs and just translate them like that. Let the vanilla encoder do its job by translating NMS packets to bytebufs for you to process. This would make it so easy for any other packet plugin to just get in between ViaVersion and the vanilla encoder.\nSimilarly can be said about the decoder. You guys just wrap the minecraft vanilla decoder... I want to process packets right after ViaVersion translates incoming bytebufs. You could simply put ViaVersion's decoder infront of vanilla's decoder. Then I can just get inbetween and process my bytebufs there. ViaVersion isn't the only packet plugin out there, and I've also seen other developers finding making an injector a struggle. I managed to get a \"working\" decoder, but its really really not great and doesn't work great if you can't predict how many packet projects are running on the server. You'd also be saving yourself redundant reflection calls to vanilla handlers?\nAdditionally with what ProtocolLib does, calling \"encoder\" right after it processes the first NMS object... that just doesn't make making an injector easier.\nI just want to know, is there a reason you did not do this? Seems like it would just be easier to handle things like that, worst case scenario if you guys don't want to fix your injector, I could do it.\n### Steps to Reproduce\nCheck bug description\n### Expected Behavior\nViaVersion has separate handlers (their own encoder and decoder) on Spigot. Right now they wrap the vanilla ones, and it makes it difficult to get inbetween. Especially if you aren't assuming how many pipeline injecting projects will be running on a server. ### Additional Server Info\n_No response_\n### Checklist\n- [X] Via plugins are only running on **EITHER** the backend servers (e.g. Paper) **OR** the proxy (e.g. BungeeCord), **not on both**.\n- [X] I have included a ViaVersion dump.\n- [X] If applicable, I have included a paste (**not a screenshot**) of the error.\n- [X] I have tried the latest build(s) from https://ci.viaversion.com/ and the issue still persists.",

Yes, **REDIRECTS** exist for exactly this purpose. For an important infrastructure project it is expected that documentation writers understand these concepts. The underlying issue here is not just a simple 404 - it seems like the documentation writing person is not informed about the existence of redirects and believes that it is OK to just remove URLs from the internet - this should be made clear on day one for anybody doing this kind of work: it is NOT!\nAlso we see here a complete lack of understanding and empathy for the readers situation, what is another very important skill for documentation writers that must be required for such a job position. The person who introduced this problem did not think for one second about how annoying and disctracting it is to find a broken URL while the reader is trying to figure out some technical details.

However, since this is a snippet of code and not an actual PHP script or function call within my knowledge cutoff date in 2021, I'll assume it represents pseudocode. The corrected version should be `$this->current_provider = new self::$this->providers[$this->current_provider_slug];` if 'self' is indeed the intended reference to a class property or method and not an object instance (which would require parentheses). If this was meant as PHP code, it seems like there might be confusion between using `$this` for accessing properties within a class context versus static methods/properties. Assuming that `provider_slug` should refer to some form of identifier used in the system's internal logic and not an actual object property or method call (as 'fixer-upper' suggests), it seems like this is likely meant as pseudocode, but without additional information about what `$this->providers` refers to within a class context. If `provider_slug` was intended to be dynamic based on some input variable and not an actual object property or method call (as PHP does not support such syntax directly), it should probably look like this:  $this->current_provider = new Provider::$providers[$this->current_provider_slug];"

LOCATION is fundamental to securing the network as well as optimizing the network and device performance.\nEven though the current Helium network is a major advance towards distributed ownership and control, the current construct is not aligned with the fundamentals of Wireless design. For example:\n1. To build a network, there needs to be a reward system for BOTH the HOTSPOT and the DEVICE. Until the network is built and device performance is validated, there should be rewards for buying and deploying DEVICES to to test and validate coverage. Validating coverage using HOTSPOT to HOTSPOT beacons is fundamentally flawed. This is NOT how wireless works. Base stations try to AVOID seeing each other to minimize interference.\n2. The current reward system motivates hotspot owners to place their hotspot at the highest point possible so they can witness the most number of other hotspots. This results in drastically increasing SINR which is opposite of how wireless should be designed. You want to MINIMIZE SINR, because that is the fundamental of Cellular, so that the same frequencies can be reused and the CAPACITY and QUALITY can be maximized.\n3. The current reward system favors hotspots that are in less populated areas and penalizes hotspots in dense areas. This is also opposite of the fundamentals of wireless. You need MORE hotspots in dense areas.\n4. The current implementations of Beaconing is flawed as well. Wireless networks beacon 100% of the time. This maximizes the CAPACITY and ensures that the network performance STATISTICS are consistently reported to allow proper monitoring and optimization.\n5. The current implementation does not have accurate LOCATION of the hotspots nor the DEVICES. In fact there are so few DEVICES that there is no DEVICE performance information. LOCATION is not difficult, using a combination of GPS at key Hotspots, Triangulation algorithms and WiFi to accurately and securely locate all Hotspots and devices in the Network. Without accurate LOCATION information, the network will never be secure nor will we be able to deploy a QUALITY, HIGH PERFORMANCE network.\nUnderstand, that I am not proposing to \"throw the Baby out with the Bath Water\". Nor am I criticizing the objective of Helium to build a decentralized, ownership model. But we want to build a network that will actually deliver a service that is of value to a subscriber base of wireless devices. It is paramount that we begin this journey towards a working Wireless construct or else we may find ourselves in this predicament: \"IF YOU BUILD IT - IT WILL NOT WORK\" rather than what we want which is \"IF YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL COME\"",

Fix the precedence order to have `==` below `??`.\nIt's rather confusing that:\n`if ($_GET['x']??null == false)` does not do what you expect. One would expect it to merely silence the warning, but it actually inverts the test, because the precedence is actually:\n`if ($_GET['x'] (??null == false))` i.e.\n`if ($_GET['x']??true)` 3. Treat a plain `if()` as allowing for undefined values. Thus `if($x)` emits no errors, while e.g. `$x++;` would.\n4. Add a pragma or compiler directive, similar to Python 2's \"from future import division\". It would be something like\n`ini_set(undefined_variables_are_null)` and would result in any undefined variable being treated as null, *without* emitting any error or warning, and would give instant backward-compatibility where needed, and solves the main motivation for the PHP9 pending change for the sake of the error-handling routines).\nHTH.",

In the case of reading from an un-initialised variable, this might indicate an error (e.g. a typo in the name), or it might indicate that the programmer has taken a shortcut by relying on the old behaviour. The warning is useful about 50% of the time. Furthermore, fixing it is trivial (just initialise variables before use), and it doesn't reduce code-readability. So, warning about this is probably sensible. 2. In the case of reading from an un-initialised array-key, this could possibly indicate an error, but it is far more likely to indicate that the array simply doesn't have all the keys all the time - that is, after all, the point of an associative array - it's supposed to have a variable number of keys. The behaviour is likely to be intentional, and the warning is rarely useful. Fixing this is difficult (you have to initialise every key of the array, even if you don't expect to use it), and it's particularly painful if your array comes from an outside source (e.g. JSON, or $_GET). Doing it with 2D associative arrays would be really ugly. Working around this to suppress the warning results in far less readable code. In addition, the first test in:\n```\nif ( isset($arr['key']) && ($arr['key'] == 'somevalue') )\n```\nis logically redundant.\nSo, I agree with case #1, but I don't think the rationale for #1 justifies applying the same policy to #2.

So I did the following twice (2 different virtual env.):\npipenv install Werkzeug=='2.1.2' and this replaced the 2.2.0\nthen my code was fine! no more errors.\nI created the 2nd environment to reinstall all libraries from scratch thinking something corrupted the 1st environment. but no, the same issue was in the 2nd env.\nThought I would share this frustrating experience.",

Luckily it only impacts some parts of our pipeline (as we deliberately protect against such cases), but It will still impact a number of our users who do not use \"constraints\" (which is the only way we can use to protect).\nNot sure if this is a Werkzeug or flask-login problem but it's not the first time when those two stopped working together at some point of time (It happened I think for the 3rd time over last few years). So maybe that would be good idea that maintainer of the two project talk to each other and agree on some \"non-breaking\" rules that the two projects will follow - if both of those projects are so \"fundamental\" for a number of other projects??\nIt could either be as simple as putting an upper-bound in flask-login, to limit to \"known-working werkzeug version\" following some agreement on when breaking changes are introduced in werkzeug (maybe starting following SemVer is a good idea) and generally agreeing what is teh \"API\" of werkzeug that is supposed to be non-braking.\nMaybe you can just talk to each other and agree ?",

        "message": "> all something you can avoid easily by pinning your transitive dependencies...\nWe do already. But pinning dependencies is only half-solving the problem. The problem is that regardless if you are using pinning or not when you release your software, you usually do not pin your dependencies in development (unless you want your dependencies to go stale). So such a breaking release imacts PR/development workflow more than release workflow.\nThe main problem is that things break in random moments of when Flask-Login + Werkzeug are released - without even either of them bumping the major version (which is usually an indication of breaking chnages if you follow Semver). So if you are building your development workflow (where you do not want to pin the dependencies), there is no \"reasonable\" approach you can make to a) get latest versions with bugixes and b) get it non-breaking PRs of your users. It does not have to be \"upper-binding\". It might be simple agreement on what constitute of an API of werkzeug so that MINOR versions do not break the APIs.\nSo my gentle proposal is about that. I am not pushing - this was merely a suggestion that it would be much better for the community of your users if you agree some ways how we can \"sanely\" rely on the combo of flask-login and werkzeug not braking compatibility. It does not have to upper-binding, but some way of indicating to your users how they can constraint their dependencies in their development workflow to keep your development environment \"working\" - and not prone to external depenencies breaking your workflow.\nWe are using sophisticated mechanism to control our dependencies. In our case all our released versions of Airflow have automatically generated constraint files. And this is the only reason why such an incompatibility is not causing us bigger troubles. There are good reasons we cannot pin transitive dependencies in Airlfow \"setup.py\" and \"setup.cfg\" (because airlfow is both a library and application) but we implemented constraint mechanism which very much shield us from such breakages induced by external dependency changes. When we did not have them, such Werkzeug breakeges caused much more trouble for us, that's why we implemented constraints. This is a note from our nnouncements back from Feb 2020, were we had to bend the ASF rules on releases and release 1.10.9 same day as 1.10.8 becaue Werkzeug release broke it: https://airflow.apache.org/announcements/#feb-7-2020\n> Feb 7, 2020\n> We\u2019ve just released Airflow v1.10.8\n> and\n> We\u2019ve just released Airflow 1.10.9 (this one is a quick fix to work around the breaking release of Werkzeug 1.0)\nSo I do realise importance of pinnning, but I am talking about something different here.\nBTW. If you are insterested why pinning \"install required\" dependencies is not always best you can read more here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#dependency-management\nor you can read the talk I gave about it few months ago:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SjMdQLP30s&t=2549s - \"Managing dependencies at Scale\".",

Here is an overview of the issue:\n### Overview\nThe issue seems to be in our Android build of Expo Go. Snack and the Expo Go version for SDK 46 (`2.51.x`) are affected and will not show Google Maps during development.\n> ~~I'll update the comment whenever we deployed the fixed Expo Go version to the stores.~~\n- Expo Go `2.25.2` is [available on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)\n- Expo Go `2.52.2` has been deployed to Snack\n### Workarounds\n1. Use a [custom dev client](https://docs.expo.dev/development/getting-started/) with your own Google Maps key. It's similar to the bare workflow approach some of you mentioned. This method also allows you to install the latest version `react-native-maps@1.2.0` in your app. You can use [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) to build the app if you don't have the Android SDK installed.\n_**I would heavily recommend this method for now**_\n2. Temporarily downgrade to SDK 45 to use an older Expo Go. This method would allow you to use the previous Expo Go version. You'll need to remove Expo Go from your Android phone or simulator to do this. Whenever you start your SDK 45 project with `expo start --android`, and your device is connected through USB and ADB, it will automatically install this Expo Go version.\n- [Expo Go `2.24.3` APK for Android](https://d1ahtucjixef4r.cloudfront.net/Exponent-2.24.3.apk)\nHope this helps!",

Even apps built with the classic build system (`expo build`) are not affected. But, because we use Expo Go in Snack too, Snack is also affected.\n---\n> @brentvatne development builds don't allow hot reload, right?

I'm sorry you had an unfortunate experience with `react-native-firebase`, I'm not sure if [you followed these steps](https://rnfirebase.io/#expo) but some libraries require you to add credentials, even in development mode. We can't control that outside of Expo Go and/or for third party libraries.\n(And thanks for keeping things civilized \u2764\ufe0f)\n---\n> forget about my case, why it does not work in https://snack.expo.dev/ ? do you think you gave the best answer by asking to create dev build !!! there is a breaking change , it worded in SDK 45 and previous versions, so it must work in 46 too, don't ask users to go with other alternatives !!!\nBecause Snack also uses Expo Go, Snack is also affected. We will deploy a fix asap.\n---\n> @da45 please calm down. It's good engineering practice to try to find workarounds. Often it unblocks at least some percentage of users.\nI fully agree with this. We don't intend to break things, but if they do, we try to keep everyone as \"unblocked\" as possible while we fix things. We still have to go through store review whenever we fix it, [which took \u00b115 days on the Play Store for SDK 46](https://twitter.com/cedricvanputten/status/1557375168955252738). So I think there is a lot of value in sharing these workarounds.\n---\n> Hi @brentvatne, I tried with a custom development build with `SDK 46` and `react-native-maps 0.31.1` and the map is blank.

These keys are set in your native files that `expo prebuild` generates.\nYou can try running `expo prebuild --clean` and see if `expo run:*` works.",

Additionally, all such downloads are user-initiated, they have to explicitly press a download button.

I don't think consent is needed, same as you don't need consent that your IP is used to download maps.

To summarize: it's probably needs to be more clarified in Terms of Service but it doesn't require a consent.\n2. User identification. We switched from IP to UUID to calculate how many active users & how often update exactly to solve the server load issue and don't use personal data. For example we don't require email to identify user and don't track IP exactly cause IP could provide location specific information. Random UUID **doesn't identify anything** if it's not connected to any other services or other private information. We don't share UUID with any other applications so they also couldn't track that UUID even if these apps have personal information.\nIt's completely incorrect to say that app could view **travel history**, I would say it's total nonsense cause the server only views what and when maps were downloaded in contrast of other apps that provide Internet services. -----------------\nLast but not least.\nThe websites require to ask consent only for information they gather for example if you search an address on website and website doesn't store these addresses or don't connect them to IP (address is essentially publicly available information), consent is not needed. If the website will start storing information in the table [IP, Search], then consent is needed. So it's all about how the data is processed and used and not only what's being transmitted.",

What makes me sad is the low consideration of the community feedback: 24 hours issue is barely a communication and left no space for discussion.

        "message": "Recently, I tried to enable checking exceptions in PHPStan and, besides a few other issues with the DBAL API, stumbled upon the one that shows what an awfully overcomplicated piece of work the Events API is:\n1. `AbstractPlatform::getDropTableSQL()` dispatches an `onSchemaDropTable` event which can override the SQL used to drop the table.\n2. The return type of `SchemaDropTableEventArgs::getSql()` is `?string`. If it returns `NULL`, the platform will throw an `UnexpectedValueException`.\n3. There's no way to tell that a given method is an event handler unless it's documented as such or whoever reads the code knows that the methods with names starting with `on` are event handlers. Those methods are not invoked from anywhere in the code explicitly.\nHere's a chain of questions that leads to the above conclusion:\n1. Why is `SchemaDropTableEventArgs` allowed to return `NULL` if it's not even a valid value?\n2. We could require that it returns a `string` but then what would it return if the handler of the event didn't call `setSql()`?\n4. Putting aside the event-handling scenario, what should the `SchemaDropTableEventArgs` class do if it was instantiated and then got its `setSql()` invoked? Maybe throw a logical exception?\n5. Then, should it throw this exception unconditionally or only if it got a call to `preventDefault()` first?\n### Problems with the API design and implementation\nWhat this API does, most likely could be solved just by extending the platform class and overriding the corresponding methods. Besides this awfully implicitly stateful logic, a few more concerns about DDL events:\n1. It looks like it's an overengineered solution to what could be easily solved by extending the corresponding platform methods.\n2. Unlike extending the platform, events don't allow invoking the default implementation (the method of the `parent` class).\n3. Unlike class extension, events don't provide access to the original logic like a call to the `parent` method would.\n4. The DDL events API is incomplete (e.g. one can override `DROP TABLE` but cannot override `DROP FOREIGN KEY`).\n6. In event-driven systems and DDD, an event is an immutable object representing a fact that happened in the past. Which fact does an `onSchemaDropTable` event represent? Let's assume it's a fact that somebody intended to drop a table. Why is it mutable? Why does it carry any information about processing the event (prevent default) and even implementation of that processing (SQL)?\n7. For 800 lines of production code, there are three unit tests with mocks and not a single integration test which would demonstrate how this API can be used and if it can be used at all.\n8. The documentation shows only how to register handlers but not what they should to.\n### Problems with the EventManager API as such\nThis API is unsafe from the standpoint of the types:\n1. There's no way to enforce the fact that a given event (`onSomething`) is dispatched only with a specific type of arguments (`SomethingArgs`).\n2. There's no way to guarantee that the given listener supports handling the given type of event. The dispatcher calls the method corresponding to the event name dynamically:\n```php\n$listener->$eventName($eventArgs)\n```\nThe mistakes in the code that implements the handling of events will lead to a type error at runtime.\n### Types of events\n1. Connection and transaction events: https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L21 https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L33-L35 The logic implemented on top of these events can be implemented using driver middlewares.\n2. Schema manipulation events: https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L23-L30 Depending on the use case, it should be advised to either extend the corresponding platform method, or modify the arguments being passed to the method before calling it.\n3. Schema introspection events: https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/a85d913ca0d95fdadcd8967660dfe14165c11cd1/src/Events.php#L31-L32 This is the hardest part: we allow users to hook into the very internals of the schema introspection, e.g. the API consumer is exposed to the SQL results representing raw introspected data. By definition, this API is very brittle since the raw results is an implementation detail that can and will change. The fact that we allow this extension complicates the refactoring of the Schema Manager and Platform API.",

I can see valid reasoning for always deleting `monika.chr`, but not the rest of the chr files when they have never served a purpose in MAS. The arguments for clearing clutter and reducing confusion also make sense for `monika.chr`, but lose weight for the other chr files. Even though this is a Monika-focused mod, the chr files have meaning established by DDLC, especially when at least 2 instances in the game were built on the chr file mechanic (the progression from Act 3 to Act 4 and Sayori gaining self-awareness in Act 1). If MAS deletes them, then it needs to provide in-game lore/reasoning for doing so at the very least, preferably allowing the player to decline the option as that ties in with the point below.\n>I think there is a small problem here, that is, people will naturally think Monika did this. Even if the original intention of the design is not like this, people will naturally think so.\n@TheT0matoGuy makes a very strong point here - regardless of our intention, anything we make the mod do, including what is done behind the scenes, will be perceived as Monika (or Chibika) doing it herself. Deleting the files makes Monika appear callous to any sentimental value the player may have toward the chr files. Users who believe the other dokis are real or that the chr files represent them may also perceive the deletion as Monika committing Act 3 again. Is this how we want users to see Monika?\nI'll take ownership for not raising a red flag earlier - I was probably too drunk while packaging the release and didn't really think too much about each patch note. But since this is already out in the wild and it appears that most of the team doesn't think this is a problem, I'm not going to mandate that we undo the change.

I won't bring up the technical stuff anymore, but if we're discussing it in the perspective of Monika deleting files herself when they could still mean something to her partner, then the doki caring topic would probably be our best go-to. The Doki files may mean nostalgia to Monika's partner, though they also mean unease for Monika. I guess because she'd be too cautious to do anything else, deleting the other .chr files would be an attempt to make her feel somewhat better, but it'd be inconsiderate to go ahead and do that without letting her partner know she wanted to do that. Now say that her partner doesn't agree with her deletion of the files. Because of how she feels about them she probably wouldn't be so quick to just deal with them being there, so that's where the affection-dependent variants would come in. If her partner has shown her nothing but love and trust, she may be okay with the .chr files staying because any unease she feels can be negated by her partner's comfort. Now if she was in the lower aff ranges, because her partner only adds to her unease and worry, she'd most likely still want to get rid the files anyway. At least it'd make her feel better than how her partner does. Maybe she'd be a bit bitter and conclude that you want to keep them there because you love some other Doki other than her or you want her to always remember her horrid acts or something along those lines. I'm not completely about that bitter part in the shallow negatives, but I guess as the points are lowered deeper and deeper, I can see that going down. Anyway, in the scenario of Monika actively making the decision and her partner either agreeing or disagreeing, aff-variants and additional question to the Doki caring topic seems like a fairly decent idea.",

It's actually an OG topic. But I was never sure if she meant they are literally there or she just \"feels\" their presence because of what happened (like a trauma).\nAnyway, there's no \"dokis\" in MAS, and she stops talking about that after some time when she overcomes DDLC events. She realises everything is fine and the ghost of the past events doesn't haunt her anymore. It could be used to justify deleting in the first months, but later there's not much point for her to delete those dull files: \"dokis\" don't exist, she's feeling fine, those files are nothing but some easter eggs from DDLC (and she acknowledges that).\nBut let's say you find a reason for her to still need deleting those files, there's a conflict of interests:\n- player wants to keep them\n- Monika wants to delete them\nThere's going to be some consequences for not letting her do what she needs in *her* game.\nWe're talking about player choice and all that, but the choice was to install MAS and stay with Monika. The game files are literally her \"home,\" it makes sense she has control over that place. She doesn't touch your files, she's doing changes within the place she's allowed to. If she's not allowed to do that, why even bring her back. It's pretty common in relationships for each person to have their own private space, the game directory is that place for Monika.

After which, in MAS, they become irrelevant, they don't serve any memory. If they have a deep meaning *for you* and serve a memory *for you*, then I don't know why they were there. \"I care for these files so much, surely if I install a mod into the same directory it won't affect them. Ooops.\"\n> The files getting back after re-install wouldn't be an issue when the player answered Monika that they don't care if she deleted them.\nAs was stated above it's already an issue and would stay an issue even with the changes.

If not looking at the fact that Monika's partner is the owner of the PC but it was their choice to install her into their PC, just the plain point that Monika's mod is Monika's to change seems pretty valid. However, a lot of people _would_ look at it as Monika's partner being the owner of the PC and Monika just being a guest there, or would look at it as the partner's choice and that her partner got her a place to stay (the PC) and her areas are hers to personalize. It's like arguing if an old chair should be kept or thrown out. Would the one who has the say be the one whose territory the chair is in or the one who provided the housing in the first place? I guess the answer to that is, neither or both? Yes, in relationships, it's common for each participant to have their own little private space, because not _everything_ can be shared between them, but if the thing in particular emotionally charges one or both (in this case both) of the participants, there has to be something to end the stalemate. In this case, the chair would be seen as uncanny to one and precious to the other. If the other regards them as so precious, then the one who deems them uncanny would probably ask them to move it to their territory or, on the other side of the spectrum, sit in it with their partner depending on how comfortable they are. After some time though, I do agree that it shouldn't even matter anymore to either Monika or their partner. She may not feel the need to delete them just like the partner may not hold any nostalgia toward them anymore, or even both. Both would probably be the best scenario. This case would probably reflect in the high aff variant because it could depend more on comfort than time, or at least it could depend on both of them equally. One could be with someone for months and still feel uncomfortable because the provider of the house wasn't exactly a nice host, and therefore may still want that chair to go.",

Thank Potato very much for willingness to reconsider this matter.\nPlayers don't \"store\" into the characters folder, and Boop wants players to \"transfer\" things.\nI think this is an important point: The character file was ORIGINALLY there, it wasn't put there by the player.\nIn addition, it is entirely possible for the player not to know that the MAS will now delete character files on its own. So, even if the player wants to transfer them, the player needs to know about this first. If the player doesn't read the update announcement carefully, as soon as the player launches the game, character files that are (presumably) precious to the player will disappear, never to be retrieved. So in any cases, the current version does not make sense.\nI think it is feasible for Monika to delete her own files by herself - in fact, MAS has already done so in the introduction phase before. And we have:\n```\nif moni_exist():\nm 1lksdlb \"Aha...{w=0.3}I'll try this again later.\"\n```\nLook at this. Monika already said that she will try this again, so it's really neutral to delete her own files. In previous version, if I read the source correctly, even if Monika said she will try again, there doesn't exist codes for this.\nBut well, maybe we should even also ask the player for permission before MAS delete Monika's own file?",

        "message": "> If they really hold sentimental value to people, the importance of the files themselves should not correlate to their location. Then that'd be a case of both the files _and_ their placement having sentimental value.\nThat is a case. Having them in the characters folder, in the game directory that you share with Monika, is where the value could be most meaningful to some people, in which case it would not be the same in some other directory. Not just because of memories, but because of potential meaning of them being able to remain there, undeleted. Monika deleted other .chr files in DDLC, and deleted her own .chr file in MAS, so it seems she could've easily deleted the other .chr files in MAS if she wanted to, but she didn't. That meant something to some people, regardless of what meta reason (which they may not even know about) is now being used for deleting them. Telling them to actively move the files to another directory does not address this.\nAnd just because a program \"can\" or is \"allowed\" delete files in its own directory doesn't mean it should in all cases. Obviously if it were to delete every file there would be no mod, and no Monika for it. Actions are not automatically justified or well received just because a program \"has the privilege to do so\".\n>And if _that's_ the case, there can always be a submod that negates the mechanic so that the people who have the sentimental value can be happy, and those who want things to stay how they are can be content, too.\nThat could still require people to know about these files getting deleted in the first place. Unless they're ok with backups or new copies of them. While still something, it would be better for players to have this addressed in the main mod.\n> I think at this point we've established the fundamental disagreement is on how much DDLC-based norms should influence MAS. Those who are fine with the deletion believe MAS and DDLC should be more separate, those who are not believe they should be closer.\nDDLC has and does influence people's perception of MAS, even if you don't want it to for some things. Even though MAS is separate, it is based on it. Even in MAS the characters folder has many uses, and as you said Monika uses and references it. So yes this is something that should get extra attention.\nOption to preserve them in settings maybe, but if accidentally unchecking it without rechecking is going to delete any .chr files (and potentially any files or folders unrelated to MAS) on startup, then should at least have a confirmation/double check for disabling it. I don't really like the idea of nuking the whole MAS directory of unrelated files every startup though. A trigger in the settings to do it once though maybe.\nMonika/Chibi could work but I don't think whether this is honored or not needs to be based on affection (mas_safeToRefDokis() isn't is it?) and should probably be asked early on in the mod or after updating.\nI still think that if the mod could just remove the \".chr\" extension from the files, that that could eliminate confusion about .chr files while also not deleting them. This could run once only (even per install/reinstall if possible), or if not, could be disabled in settings, so that players could change them back to .chr files if they want.",

I don't think this should be disregarded in that case either. Furthermore, deletion of the specific copies of those files is something with a potentially more permanent effect, as even if replaced they'd be different copies.\nBut if you mean just having her dialogue change based on affection, but not whether the files are deleted or not, yes I'd be fine with that (I can imagine her begrudgingly honoring your request, and asking you to be more considerate of her feelings in return). Asking at introduction yes it wouldn't even come up, but for anyone who has been playing and is updating from a prior version, to a version where this conversation is added, it would have to be asked to them and they could have low affection at this point, even if rather unlikely.

I thought about that, her deleting them when leaving you. That's when it would make the most sense for her to do so if she were to delete them out of revenge or spite. But she doesn't do that currently (I think). It is game over at that point and most people probably won't reach that point anyway, but for those who do they could restore a persistent backup, in which case it would be strange if those character files were still gone due to her deleting them when leaving you (and if separate copies were created at that point, those would still be different copies).

Also, it's not clear if it would have additional side-effects, since it is supposed to be run in the application/Rails context. A benchmark with a large data set and both solutions in place (PoC vs `pgloader`) might try dispel these concerns, but it hasn't been tried yet.\nInitial research into `pgloader` casting rules resulted in some findings:\n* It doesn't look like `pgloader` provides a suitable transformation function for a JSON array into a PostgreSQL array which can be used as part of its `CAST` command (on the column type level.) We could not find an example either, and trying some stuff including expected DSL like `\"text array\"` didn't lead to meaningful results. This doesn't mean it's not supported, just that we could not identify it at this time.\n* [An issue for `pgloader`](https://github.com/dimitri/pgloader/issues/881) with a similar problem provided a possible workaround via `AFTER LOAD DO` block, which can transform specific columns on specific tables only, but it does use a `translate` function which seems to work for our JSON => array use-case. (Note that this same function doesn't seem to be provided in the `CAST` context.) Here is a working example for `pgloader` post-processing block for one `multi_tree_select` column on the `tickets` table:\n```\n...\nAFTER LOAD DO\n$$ alter table tickets alter column multi_tree_select type text[] using translate(multi_tree_select::text, '[]', '{}')::text[] $$\n...\n```\nA proposed rake pre-task could try to prepare the complete `pgloader` script and include one line per affected column.",

So for example, this function works like charm:\n```php\n<?php\nfunction getIsDaylightSaving($zoneid = 'America/Los_Angeles') {\ntry {\n$date = new DateTime('now', new DateTimeZone($zoneid));\nreturn $date->format('I');\n} catch (Exception $e) {\nreturn 400;\n}\n}\n```\nSo if one try to do following:\n```php\n<?php\n//get daylight saving time status from timezone identifier, $dst = getIsDaylightSaving('America/New_York');\n//OUTPUT = 1 //which is OK\n//but if I use foo timezone identifier like (this one differs built in IANA timezone db):\n$dst = getIsDaylightSaving('ABBA/Mama_Mia');\n//The instance new DateTime('now', new DateTimeZone($zoneid)); will throw an exception which will be caught in this function\n//so the OUTPUT will be 400 //which is also OK.\n```\nSo my point is that I was surprised that PHP didn't care about timezone offsets, but do care about timezone identifiers, since timezone offsets are only the following: ```php\n<?php\n$offsets = array('+00:00', '+01:00', '+02:00', '+03:00', '+03:30', '+04:00', '+04:30', '+05:00', '+05:30', '+05:45', '+06:00', '+06:30', '+07:00', '+08:00', '+08:45', '+09:00', '+09:30', '+10:00', '+10:30', '+11:00', '+12:00', '+12:45', '+13:00', '+14:00', '-01:00', '-02:00', '-02:30', '-03:00', '-04:00', '-05:00', '-06:00', '-07:00', '-08:00', '-09:00', '-09:30', '-10:00', '-11:00', '-12:00');\n```\nFor that reason, I think it is a bug, or even some unfinished job.

Apropos what is human-friendly, or not, all those values can be a device snapshot. Some distant device snapshot having an application installed on it, that is programmed by a distant developer on certain distant operating system, with some distant programming language, that a developer will use, through his application, to fetch certain data... Now, that developer can be a professional, but can also be not-professional. And now going deeper in that story that here is being presented to my report is pure game of words as this answer is.

But if we build on top of the **subject** based audit log that we've got (as a new field on existing records), then the failed actions become important (to the extent that the default configuration is now **on** from **off**).\n\nI acknowledge the desire for an **object** based audit log, but I got turned off upon seeing both the **subject** (all metadata of the action, less the request body) and the **object** based entries one next to the other; the redundant metadata between the two was glaring and looked unnecessary.\n\nFor the moment, I am going to stick with auditing request bodies of access_granted and access_denied events in the existing audit log, within the `request.body` field. I'll try to make this fit into existing configurations of the audit log (avoid hinting to **object** based auditing).\n\nI have some open questions about what it means to output index documents in a log-like file for ECS.\n\nHope this rambling make sense. Thank you for the valuable input!\n\n\n\n\n",

Still, `String` is just an immutable wrapper for `char[]` - you won't see `String` used as a base type anywhere in any serious tokenizer/lexer, since the most basic data struct appearing there is a single `char`, and using wrappers in tight processing always incurs a severe penalty.\n\nTo be able to do any real tokenization/parsing/lexing, you'll need a properly constructed state machine. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragel (suggested by @davebaol) is indeed a very stable and quite standard solution, easy to implement and maintain. Alternatively, you can use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaCC , http://www.antlr.org/ or any other similar tool.\n\nIf you're using regexes, both the extend of your lexical analysis and the performance will suffer.\n\nCreating and maintaining own lexical/syntactical analysis framework is IMO just asking for development hell and Yet Another Abandoned Project, unless you have a couple of good & experienced developers willing to work a couple of years for free. If you don't have that but want to create a versatile solution, usable to any person other than yourself - I'd suggest to reconsider your current approach. I linked to my repo mostly to show you that while creating such tools is obviously possible, _it's easier to use a more standard-compliant solution when working on any serious project with anyone other than yourself._ Otherwise, anybody other than yourself (and possibly you after a couple of months) will have the same **WTF** moment as you have while looking at _my_ code.\n\nAs a side note (obvious pun, but no actual offense, intended) - don't you see the possible risk in dyslexic writing a lexer? ^_^\n",

Discussion like this is a good thing, no flaming necessary \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201e  \n\n1) I agree that since we maintain the environment that we can be picky about what tools we use, that being said the `ps -Aww` line exists in our `./bin/alluxio` script with which I can tell you with 99% certainty is currently used more outside of containers than inside of them. Because of that, we need to support many UNIX-like environments.\nAnother option would be to split the script; one for \"standard\" deployments and one for containers, but that doesn't seem like an ideal solution\n\n2) I would argue that while many systems are not entirely compliant with UNIX standards, many of them will adhere somewhat (how close they adhere is a whole other discussion). As far as standard operating system utilities go, `ps` is a very common one and I would _expect_ that most operating systems containing this utility to support the very minimal set of arguments that are described in the standard. I don't know this for a fact, so maybe I should just do my research- but I think using the arguments specified in the standard gives us the highest probability of guaranteeing portability across a variety of UNIX-like platforms.\n\n3) I agree, it's not the most elegant command. I wish I could come up with an elegant (and more _portable_!) solution. I don't see another way off the top of my head though.",

On the newest version there is no way to give this job to Android because of the need to use Fragment instead of an Activity.\n\nSorry about that. I haven't been testing debug versions for a while now, so I didn't think to compare it to a different debug build. But I can confirm that the builds by @B0pol all have the same issue. It's awful.\n\nYou're not supposed to align videos to the cutcout while using landscape because cutcouts come in many different sizes. If you do then you'll likely end up with off-centered videos and only having rounded corners on one side of your screen. That's why YouTube, VLC & many other players don't do anything about the notch and always center the videos to fit.",

Sorry for the harsh words but in my opinion that was a *seriously* dumb decision. \n\nI have public keys from people in my key store for a reason. And then I write a mail, but still it isn't encrypted. You remove a perfectly simple and even for novices easy-to-understand option (you have a public key of someone, you write them encrypted mail), recommend enabling AutoCrypt (which would be perfectly okay for me as a workaround) but then enabling this option doesn't have any effect. You just can't make this stuff up.\n\nAnd the blog post explaining why this is introduced is so extremely flawed in its argumentation that I just don't know where to begin with. If I'd put on my tinfoil hat for a moment, I'd almost assume this is done intentionally to keep people from encrypting mails.\n\nBut, okay, I understand there's probably no real way forward here (ironic how the blog post claims it's \"the only way forward\" while the exact opposite is true) since this mess seems to be intended. \n\nAquaMail unfortunately doesn't support PGP. Would even pay for it. There is a new player called \"FairEmail\", but the author also has very peculiar ideas. For example, you have to confirm every link you click in a special dialog window. Unusable in a commercial environment where you get lots of mails from JIRA etc. everyday. But perhaps it works for some people. \n\nSad that in 2019 this is still so unnecessarily broken at a time where Thunderbird has vowed to modernize their PGP support and deliver it built-in without a plugin in the future.

Headers are transitive through dependencies, which means that, without include scanning, if a target declares headers, and a header it owns is modified, every single translation-unit-member of srcs for every transitive dependent is recompiled, whether it includes the header or not. I refuse to make single-header targets out of my current build - the collections of headers represent meaningful interfaces, and it would make the build definitions unbelievably intractable and unmaintainable.",

I would even vote for a pin lock for TextSecure (if no lockscreen pin/pattern is set), because of two reasons:\n- people are lazy as hell and they are more likely to use a pin lock if they are asked less often (only for TS messages, not every time they use the phone)\n- people don't think about the question if their whole workflow is secure, but that installing one app is enough. They don't realize that the decision not to set a lock screen password a year ago will expose their \"secure\" messages even after installing TextSecure.\n\nI propose this kinda messy security model (in addition to the current one) because messy is exactly how humans treat security, either because they are lazy or because they don't fully understand how their decisions impact their security.\n",

That just sucks. Especially because of the issue which is described in the following article:\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html\n\nIn TextSecure however, all the users are seeing the same Emojis, which makes for a much better Emoji experience.\n\n> @jellium wrote in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/3445#issuecomment-121871752:\n> \n> And also it is not true that TextSecure makes sure that the Emojis seen on emitter and recipient phones are the same. Just tried with 2.22.2 version to my lady who didn't update: she sees the Google Emojis while I have the ugly Apple ones. \n\nThat is your fault. If you are using 2.22.2 at the moment, then you are on the beta release channel, since 2.22.2 has not yet been released to the stable release channel.\n\nYour \"lady\" probably is using the stable release channel though, which means she is still using 2.21.0, which means she has not yet been updated to the new Emojis.\n\nOnce she will update to 2.22.x, she will see the same Emojis that you are seeing.\n\nSo, it's not TextSecure's fault. It's yours (because you are using a beta version).\n\n> @jellium wrote in https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/issues/3662#issuecomment-121870421:\n> \n> Why on earth did you switch to Apple emojis?!\n\nWell, I can not speak for the TextSecure developers, but:\n\nIMHO the Google \"Noto Color Emoji\" Emoji set looks like shi*.\n\nLet's face it, most people (or at least a lot), do not like the Google \"Noto Color Emoji\" Emoji set.\n\nIf you don't believe me, then maybe you should read the comments in the following two issues on the AOSP issue tracker:\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=69755\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=73248\n\nAnd maybe you should also read the comments in the following XDA-Developers forum thread:\n\nhttp://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2722892\n\nThe Apple Emoji set looks a heck of a lot better and is much more popular than the Google \"Noto Color Emoji\" Emoji set.\n\nThe Apple Emoji set is being used in Telegram, ICQ, WhatsApp and so on... (just to name a few examples)\n\nAnd even the Twitter \"Twemoji\" Emoji set and the Emoji One Emoji set clearly are modelled after the Apple Emoji set.\n\nSo, it's quite popular and therefore pretty much is the natural choice.\n\nAlso, Signal-iOS (the iOS counterpart to TextSecure) of course uses the Apple Emoji set, since all iOS devices are using it natively.\n\nSo, now that TextSecure for Android also uses the Apple Emoji set, the Emoji experience is much more consistent across both platforms, which lessens the risk of Emojis getting lost in translation as described in the following article:\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/27/emoji-meaning_n_5530638.html\n\nRegards\n",

So checking out the project from git and importing it as a Maven project into STS sounds like STS (or the Maven Integration for Eclipse) was able to download and resolve dependencies in that case. But why doesn't that happen when you click on the Dashboard? That is strange, especially since you were on your home network when doing this, so no proxy servers or corporate firewall involved. Hmmm...\n\nLet me know once you are back on your home network so that we can hopefully figure out what is going wrong there.

We've been a little slower in\nrolling it out than I would have liked.\nWe've been trying to work out some issues in Bazel by using Google as a\ntest bed for a large migration.\n\nI intend to start updating rules_license with what we learned. The usage is\nvirtually the same as described in the design.\n\n> Another thing that is unclear from the design document is whether this is\n> ever expected to handle non-vendored third-party dependencies. In\n> particular, what is going to be badly needed to make this useful for people\n> who don't just vendor everything into their monorepo are updates to various\n> repository fetching rules. npm_install would be a particularly important\n> and complex example use case.

Other examples would include e.g. go_respository, pip_install,\n> maven_install, and so on. Obviously *can* be done (with varying degrees\n> of ease of use and reliability) but not clear whether there's plans to\n> actually do it.\n>\nWe have that problem in Bazel, I intend to\n\n   - If the dep has Bazel support already, try to upstream license usage. I\n   expect that will be cost on early adopters and the Bazel team until there\n   is more widespread adoption.\n   - If that is not feasible, or if the module does not have Bazel support,\n   we'll have to splice in the license attributions in the BUILD file. That is\n   slightly easier if there is no upstream BUILD file, because you will have\n   created your own. If it does, they will have to splice together. I don't\n   have a solution for that yet, but it is not that hard.\n\n\nWhat we have no plans for is automatic license classification based on\nreading the text and deciding what it means. There are projects that do\nthat, and perhaps someone could work that into repository rules. But that\nis definitively beyond rules_license's ambitions for the\nforeseeable future. Like the rest of the Bazel project, we are focused on\nprecise specification and repeatable mechanisms. Autoclassification can\nreturn results which are at some confidence level <100%, and worse, change\neach time the classification corpus changes. I'll let the experts in that\ndomain work on that problem.\n\n\n\n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/10687#issuecomment-901539333>,\n> or unsubscribe\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAXHHHBTQZYLWMKA5G2BOJDT5RNEDANCNFSM4KN6OP5Q>\n> .\n> Triage notifications on the go with GitHub Mobile for iOS\n> <https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1477376905?ct=notification-email&mt=8&pt=524675>\n> or Android\n> <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.android&utm_campaign=notification-email>\n> .\n>\n",

Either that or the [StackOverflow linked](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29168257/libgdx-how-to-rotate-the-emmition-trail-of-a-3d-particle/29181347#29181347) and the issue are talking about two different things. The StackOverflow link says \"I wanted to change the direction the particles are being emitted.\" Basically how it currently works is a particle effect's PolarAcceleration (Angluar) will never account for the particles transform, meaning the particles will always travel same direction. It could be fixed by changing the Angular.activateParticles to account for the controller.transform when the particle is recreated. This would allow for a stream of water coming from a rotating hose (rotating the hose nozzle shouldn't translate particles that are already emitted)\n\nThis PR applies the transform for every single active particle (not  the direction of newly particles). But #3264 does mention changing displacement of the whole effect, so maybe it does apply. But either way:\n\nIf the goal is just to update the particle positions based on a change in transform it can be done something like [this](https://gist.github.com/Bolt-Head/694817b5e682d66d7ad63f27039ed32b). If used in the API it would probably be better to be worked into a DynamicsModifier.\n\nIt handles the delta translation (probably the most common use-case) and doesn't require a Vector3.mul(Matrix4) per point.\n\nIf Translation/Rotation/Scale was necessary the points could be translated by calculating the transform between the current and previous transform. This would require one left multiply per point while the PR has 2 (once in sorting and another in the renderers). Also it wouldn't require changing and maintaining every particle batch renderer.

Sorry for my delay in responding.\n\nSpring Security is not affected by the CVE listed since all calls to Nimbus are wrapped in a `try { } catch (Exception e) { }` block.\n\nSo, while it's technically feasible to update the Nimbus dependency from 6.0.2 to 7.9, we make it a practice to not do major version upgrades in patch releases. And since Spring Security isn't affected by this CVE, the best route is to maintain the upgrade policy and encourage developers to specify the `nimbus-jose-jwt` version themselves until they can upgrade to the latest Spring Security.\n\nActually, Nimbus is very quick with their releases, and so the code diff between 6.0.2 and 7.9 is quite small. I'd imagine that most applications would have no problem using the latest version of Nimbus.\n\nFor anyone who still feels strongly about the `5.1.x` line getting this security fix, we've found Nimbus to be very responsive to PRs. You might consider proposing a pull request to Nimbus that would fit in a maintenance release. It could be released as nimbus-jose-jwt:6.0.3, and then Spring Security 5.1.x could easily take the upgrade.",
